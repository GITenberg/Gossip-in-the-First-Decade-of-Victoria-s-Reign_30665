<p>I have written this Gossip not only for the edification of
those to whom a portion, more or less, may be news, but for those
who, like myself, have lived through the whole of Queen
Victoria&rsquo;s reign, to whom the remembrance of things, almost
forgotten, may bring pleasure and excite interest.&nbsp; The
items, herein displayed, have been gathered from many sources,
and their authenticity is guaranteed by giving the name of the
authority whence they were taken, in very many instances
<i>ipsissima verba</i>, as paraphrasing would rob them of their
freshness and individuality.&nbsp; All the illustrations are
contemporaneous, and, good or bad, belong to the text and should
not be altered.</p>

Accession&mdash;Proclamation&mdash;Funeral of the King&mdash;The
Queen and social functions&mdash;Mr. Montefiore&mdash;Amusing
letter&mdash;Electric telegraph&mdash;Knocker
wrenching&mdash;Amusements of the young aristocracy.</p>
<p>King William the Fourth was as sincerely fond of his niece,
Alexandrina Victoria, as he cordially detested her mother, and he
earnestly hoped that she might obtain her majority, which took
place on the 24th of May, 1837, before he died, for he had a
horror of the Duchess of Kent having even the shadowy power of a
Regent.&nbsp; Greville, in his <i>Memoirs</i>, writing on 23rd of
May, says: &ldquo;The King prayed that he might live till the
Princess Victoria was of age, and he was very nearly dying just
as the event arrived.&nbsp; He is better, but supposed to be in a
very precarious state.&nbsp; There has been a fresh squabble
between Windsor and Kensington about a proposed allowance to the
Princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old King lived but a very short time after the desired
event, for he expired at 2.12 on the morning of the 20th of June,
1837, and how the sad news was broken to the young Sovereign may
best be told in the words of that mine of anecdote, Miss Frances
Williams Wynn, the daughter of Sir Watkin Williams Wynn (the
fourth baronet):</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On Monday we were listening all day for the
tolling of the bells, watching whether the guests were going to
the Waterloo dinner at Apsley House.&nbsp; On Tuesday, at
2&frac12; <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>a.m., the scene closed, and in a very
short time the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham, the
Chamberlain, set out to announce the event to their young
Sovereign.&nbsp; They reached Kensington Palace at about five;
they knocked, they rang, they thumped for a considerable time
before they could rouse the porter at the gates; they were again
kept waiting in the courtyard, then turned into one of the lower
rooms, where they seemed forgotten by everybody.&nbsp; They rang
the bell, desiring that the attendant of the Princess Victoria
might be sent to inform H.R.H. that they requested an audience on
business of importance.&nbsp; After another delay, and another
ringing to enquire the cause, the attendant was summoned, who
stated that the <i>Princess</i> was in such a sweet sleep, she
could not venture to disturb her.&nbsp; Then they said, &lsquo;We
come to the <i>Queen</i> on business of State, and even her sleep
must give way to that.&rsquo;&nbsp; It did; and, to prove that
<i>she</i> did not keep them waiting, in a few minutes she came
into the room in a loose white night-gown and shawl, her nightcap
thrown off, and her hair falling upon her shoulders, her feet in
slippers, tears in her eyes, but perfectly collected and
dignified.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lord Melbourne was summoned to Kensington Palace by the Queen
at 9 a.m., and a Privy Council was called for 11 a.m., but the
notice was so short that several of the Privy Councillors had no
time to put on their official costume, and were obliged to attend
in undress.&nbsp; Amongst others who made their appearance at
Court in this novel fashion were the Duke of Cumberland (then, by
the fact of the King&rsquo;s death, King of Hanover) and Lord
Glenelg.</p>
<p>The Queen was proclaimed the next day, but there is no need to
detail the ceremony, as we have all experienced a similar scene
lately.&nbsp; The existing ministry was retained, and things
settled down in their places, yet not quite all at once, for
<i>The Western Luminary</i>, a paper long since defunct, says,
&ldquo;In one writ which came down to this city, a ludicrous
mistake was made in the date, as follows: &lsquo;In the year of
Our Lady 1837,&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;Our
Lord.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; And the Royal Arms had to be altered
from those borne by Her Majesty&rsquo;s five predecessors.&nbsp;
<!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>Being a female, they had to be borne on a lozenge,
instead of a shield; the crest of a lion surmounting a crown was
discontinued, as was also the escutcheon of pretence bearing the
arms of Hanover, surmounted by the crown of that country.</p>
<p>The preparations for the funeral of the late King were at once
commenced; and, in connection therewith, I cannot help quoting
from <i>The Times</i>&rsquo; Windsor Correspondent (28 June):
&ldquo;In the platform erected for the interment of George IV.,
there were more than 70,000 superficial feet of boarding, and
49,000 feet of quartering.&nbsp; The quantity of black cloth used
for covering the floor of, and the roof over, amounted to more
than 10,000 yards.&nbsp; I understand that, after the interment,
it becomes the perquisite of the clergy of the chapel, as do,
also, many of the decorative ornaments placed on, and suspended
over, the coffin.&nbsp; You will, perhaps, recollect what some
people would willingly have you forget&mdash;I mean the
squabbling which occurred respecting the velvet cushion upon
which the coronet of the late Princess Charlotte rested at her
funeral, and the scramble which took place for the real or
supposed baton of the Duke of York, on the occasion of his
burial.&nbsp; Care was taken to prevent the occurrence of any
such indecent proceedings at the funeral of George IV., and,
hence, I do not anticipate any such scenes on the present
occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King was buried with great pomp on the night of the 8th of
July, the Duke of Sussex being chief mourner, and Queen Adelaide
occupying the Royal Closet.&nbsp; At the close of the ceremony,
the members of the procession, who were much fatigued by the toil
they had undergone and by the sultry heat of the chapel,
proceeded to quit as quickly and as quietly as possible, but
nothing like order was observed in the return to the
Palace.&nbsp; In fact, it was, for a considerable time, a scene
of indescribable confusion.&nbsp; Arrangements had been made, by
orders of the Earl Marshal, for the places at which the carriages
of those who had to take part in the procession were to set down
and take up; but, owing to the immense number of the carriages,
the ignorance of many of the coachmen as to the prescribed
regulations, and the obstinacy of <!-- page 4--><a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>others, the
rules very soon became a dead letter, and every man seemed
disposed to take his own way.&nbsp; This, as might be expected,
caused such confusion that it was long past midnight before
anything like order was restored.&nbsp; There were smashed panels
and broken windows in abundance, but no serious accidents were
recorded.</p>
<p>The Queen soon had plenty of business on her hands, and on
30th June she gave her assent to forty Bills, one of which (a
remarkably short one), the 7 Gul., iv. and i. Vic., c. 23,
enacted: &ldquo;That from and after the passing of this Act,
Judgment shall not be given and awarded against any Person or
Persons convicted of any Offence that such Person or Persons do
stand in, or upon the Pillory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Owing to the recent
change in Sovereigns, there were a few slips in &ldquo;Her
Majesty,&rdquo; and &ldquo;La Reine le veult.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the
13th July the Queen and her mother left Kensington Palace and
took up their residence in Buckingham Palace.&nbsp; On the 17th,
the Queen dissolved Parliament in person, dressed in white satin,
decorated with gold and jewels, wearing the Order of the Garter
and a rich diadem and necklace of diamonds.&nbsp; She bore the
function remarkably well, although one evening paper said that
&ldquo;Her emotion was plainly discernible in the rapid heaving
of her bosom, and the brilliancy of her diamond stomacher, which
sparkled out occasionally from the dark recess in which the
throne was placed, like the sun on the swell of the smooth ocean,
as the billows rise and fall&rdquo;!&nbsp; On the 19th July she
held her first lev&eacute;e, and on the 20th her first drawing
room.</p>
<p>Having dutifully chronicled the doings of Royalty, let us do
the same by meaner folk.&nbsp; On 24th June, Mr. Moses
Montefiore, the celebrated Jewish philanthropist, who lived over
one hundred years, was elected Sheriff of London, and, on the 9th
Nov. following, he received the honour of Knighthood.&nbsp; He
was the first Jew who ever served the office of Sheriff, or who
had been made a Knight, in England.</p>
<p>Of course, there were no Board Schools in those days, and
education was somewhat lax, but it will do no harm to note a
piece of orthography, which will show the standard at which the
middle lower class had then arrived.&nbsp; It is copied from <!--

5</span><i>The Times</i> of 29 June, 1837.&nbsp; &ldquo;(<i>From
an Evening Paper</i>)&mdash;Last autumn, Mrs. C---, of London,
during a visit to --- House, in the West of Scotland, called one
day, along with some other ladies, in the family carriage, at the
Golden Arms Inn, of a sea bathing place on the coast, and stopped
for about an hour.&nbsp; Some time after the party had returned
to D--- House, Mrs. C--- discovered that she had lost a very fine
boa, which she supposed she must have left at the Inn.&nbsp; On
enquiry, no trace of the boa could be found; but, about two
months after Mrs. C---&rsquo;s return to London, she received a
parcel with a boa somewhat torn, accompanied by the accompanying
(<i>sic</i>) epistle, which we give as rather a curiosity of its
kind:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Golden Arms
Inn&mdash;29 Oct., 1836.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. C---, London,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Madum</span>,&mdash;I was sorry to
heer that when you lost your Bowa in my huse, that the Bowa was
stole by my sarvant lasses; and the sarvants at D--- House spred
a report against my huses karakter, which no person ever
questioned afore.&nbsp; My wiffe, Peggy, was muckle vexed at the
report, and sershed the trunks of all the lasses, but did not
find your Bowa; she fund in Jenny McTavish&rsquo;s kist half a
pund of tea which Jenny had stole from my wiffes cupboard.&nbsp;
Jenny denied taking your Bowa; but not doubting that you would
tell a lee, and as Jenny tuke the tea, my wife thocht she must
have taken your Bowa too, so I turned off Jeny for your
satisfaction.&nbsp; She went home to her mithers house in ---,
and four Sundays after, wha should be cocken in the breist of the
laft, all set round with ribbons in her heed, but Miss Jeny with
your Bowa on her shoulders, like a sow with a saddle on its
back.&nbsp; I stopped her coming out of the kirk.&nbsp; So So,
Miss Jeny (says I) hae ye stumped the cow of her tale, or is this
the ladies Bowa ye have on your sholders?&nbsp; The brazen faced
woman had the impudence to deny the Bowa was yours, and said her
sweetheart had bot it for her in a secondhand shop in the Salt
Market of Glasgow.&nbsp; But I cut matters short wi&rsquo; Jeny;
I een, as if by your authority, tuke <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the law in my
own hand, and tore the Bowa from her sholders; it was torn a
little in the scuffle wi&rsquo; Jeny and me afore the
congregation in the kirk yard, but I carried it off in spite of
her, and now send it to you, hopping you will put a letter in the
newspaper of Lundon cleering the karacter of me and my wiffe
Peggy, and my Inn of the Golden Arms.&nbsp; As for Miss Jeny ye
may mak her as black as auld nick, for over and above Peggies
half pund of tea, and your Bowa, Jeny (I hae good reason to
believe) is no better than she should be.&nbsp; I am, Madum, your
vera humbel sarvint,</p>

<p>It will hardly be credited that at the commencement of 1837
there was only one railway running out of London, and that was
the Greenwich railway, which, however, only went as far as
Deptford, where it deposited its passengers in the midst of
market gardens, leaving them to walk or ride to Greenwich.&nbsp;
But there were several running in the midlands (six railways in
all England), and what was then called &ldquo;The Grand Junction
Railway,&rdquo; from Liverpool to Birmingham, was opened on the
4th July of this year.&nbsp; Cognate with railways is the
practical working of the Electric Telegraph, now so necessary to
their being.&nbsp; On 12 June, 1837, a patent was granted (No.
7390) to William Fothergill Cooke, of Breeds Place, Hastings, and
Charles Wheatstone, of Conduit Street, Hanover Square, for their
invention of &ldquo;Improvements in giving signals and sounding
alarums at distant places by means of electric currents
transmitted through metallic circuits.&rdquo;&nbsp; This hitherto
scientific toy was first tried on 25 July by permission of the
London and North Western Railway (then in progress) between
Euston and Camden Town stations, and its successful operation was
witnessed with delight by Fox and R. Stephenson, amongst many
others.</p>
<p>A great feature in this year was the &ldquo;Tom and
Jerryism&rdquo; (so called from Pierce Egan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life
in London,&rdquo; 1821) that existed, especially among the upper
class of young men.&nbsp; Foremost of all was the Marquis of
Waterford, whose delight was in the company of prize fighters,
<i>et hoc genus omne</i>, and <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>whose idea of
amusement consisted in visiting the lowest public houses, and
treating everybody with liquor, even pails full of gin being
distributed to whoever would partake of it&mdash;being never so
happy as when the debauch ended in a fight.&nbsp; Knocker
wrenching and similar pranks were his delight, and <i>Punch</i>,
at the very commencement of vol. i., gives a suggestion for a
monument to him.&nbsp; His pranks would fill a volume, and in
August of this year (during a yachting trip), whilst at Bergen,
he received a blow on the head from a stalwart watchman that
nearly killed him.</p>

<p>Here is a specimen police case.&nbsp; <i>Times</i>, 10
<i>July</i>, 1837:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Bow Street</span>.&mdash;On
Saturday (8th July) three persons were brought before Mr.
Minshull, charged with twisting knockers off hall doors,
assaulting the police, and other disorderly conduct; and, it
having been rumoured that one of the parties charged was the
Marquis of Waterford, a great <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>crowd of
persons assembled in front of the Office to catch a glimpse of
his Lordship.&nbsp; It proved, however, that the gentleman
alluded to was not the noble Marquis himself, but his brother,
Lord William Beresford, who gave the name of Charles
Ferguson.&nbsp; Two other persons were placed in the dock besides
his Lordship, one of whom gave the name of Edward Hammersley, of
41, St. James&rsquo;s Street, and the other, who was equipped in
the garb of a waterman, said his name was George Elliott, and
that he was his Lordship&rsquo;s coxswain.</p>
<p>William Dodds, a police constable of the E division, No. 9,
then stated that he was on duty in Museum Street, between 1 and
2, on the previous night, when he saw the two gentlemen at the
bar go up to the house, No. 49, and wrench the knocker from the
door.&nbsp; Witness expostulated with them, and, seeing another
knocker in the hand of the prisoner Elliott, he took him by the
collar, upon which the prisoner Hammersley dropped the knocker
which he had just carried off.&nbsp; The prisoner Ferguson then
came up, and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, old boy,&rdquo;
and offered him money, which witness refused to take.&nbsp; The
two gentlemen then ran away, but were soon apprehended, witness
still retaining hold of Elliott.&nbsp; They were then conveyed to
the police station, where Ferguson refused to be searched,
declaring that he would not submit to such a rascally
degradation, and, having said so, he struck witness.&nbsp; The
prisoners were then locked up.</p>
<p>Mr. William Gibson, of 49, Museum Street, proved that one of
the knockers produced belonged to him, and had been wrenched off
his street door.</p>
<p>Ferguson, in his defence, said he had been up the river on a
boating excursion, and had taken &ldquo;rather too much
wine.&rdquo;&nbsp; The other two prisoners also pleaded having
taken a drop too much.</p>
<p>Mr. Minshull observed that there were two charges against
Ferguson, whom he should consider as the principal offender, and
should fine him &pound;5 for unlawful possession of one of the
knockers, and &pound;5 for assaulting the police constable in the
execution of his duty.&nbsp; He should not fine the other
two.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Ferguson said he had no objection to pay &pound;5 for the
knocker, but, as he denied the assault, he should appeal against
the fine.</p>
<p>Mr. Minshull informed him that there was no appeal in the
case, but he intimated that Mr. Ferguson might go to prison, if
he pleased, instead of paying the fine.</p>
<p>Ferguson: Oh, there&rsquo;s no occasion for that; I shall pay
the fine.</p>
<p>Mr. Minshull then desired him to come round in front of the
bench, and said to him: &ldquo;I dare say, Sir, you have money
enough at your disposal, but I pray you not to entertain the
notion that you can therefore do as you think fit in the streets
of this metropolis, either by night, or by day.&nbsp; You were
brought before me, recently, for a similar offence, when I fined
you &pound;5, and I now warn you, that if you should again appear
before me, under circumstances like the present, I shall, most
assuredly, feel it to be my duty, not to inflict a pecuniary fine
upon you&mdash;for that is no punishment to a person in your
station&mdash;but I shall send you, at once, as I am authorized
to do, to hard labour in the House of Correction, and you will
then see that neither rank, nor riches, can entitle you to the
privilege of committing depredations upon the property of
peaceable and industrious persons, or of disturbing the peace and
quiet of this town with impunity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The noble Lord was then handed over to the custody of the
gaoler, and his two companions were discharged.&nbsp; It appeared
that he had not sufficient money about him to pay the fines, but
his brother, the Marquis of Waterford, after visiting him in
&ldquo;durance vile,&rdquo; released him from his ignoble
captivity by paying the fines.</p>
<p>On the same day, his brother, Lord James Beresford, was
arrested for disgusting behaviour, and two &ldquo;young men of
genteel appearance,&rdquo; who gave false names, were taken in
custody by the police for maliciously upsetting a shell-fish
stall.</p>
<p>One more illustration of the amusements and behaviour of the
<i>jeunesse dor&eacute;e</i> of that period will suffice.&nbsp;
<i>Times</i>, 25 <i>Nov.</i></p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span><span class="smcap">Marlborough
Street</span>.&mdash;Lord Harley, of Chester Place, Capt. W. E.
Reynolds, of Jermyn Street, and Mr. Charles Lushington, of
Tavistock Hotel, were on Thursday (23 Nov.) brought before Mr.
Chambers, charged with having practised the fashionable amusement
of ringing door bells.</p>
<p>Mr. Young, surgeon, Piccadilly, said, about 5 o&rsquo;clock
that morning he was roused by a violent ringing at his
bell.&nbsp; He answered the summons immediately.</p>
<p>Capt. Reynolds: It&rsquo;s a --- lie.&nbsp; You have committed
perjury.</p>
<p>Mr. Lushington (to the complainant): You are a --- liar.&nbsp;
The fact is, I hurt my fingers and wanted some diachylum
plaister, and I therefore rang the bell of the first surgeon I
came to.&nbsp; This is the truth.&nbsp; So help me, God.</p>
<p>Mr. Young continued: When he got to the door, he found that
all the three defendants had gone away; and he immediately
followed them, and demanded their reason for disturbing
him.&nbsp; The defendants turned upon him, and made use of
language and epithets which he would not pollute his lips by
repeating.</p>
<p>Capt. Reynolds (shaking his stick at the witness): I wish I
had you elsewhere.</p>
<p>Mr. Lushington: I&rsquo;d roll you in the kennel, if it was
worth while.</p>
<p>Mr. Young continued: The altercation attracted the notice of
the police, and witness gave them into custody.&nbsp; When they
got to the station house, and witness was proceeding to make the
charge, the defendants repeated their disgusting epithets and
language.</p>
<p>It is impossible to do more than to remark that the language
was of a description hitherto presumed to be confined to the
vilest class of the community.</p>
<p>Mr. Young added that all the defendants appeared to be
intoxicated.</p>
<p>Lord Harley: I beg pardon, I was sober.</p>
<p>Inspector Beresford was sworn to the fact.</p>
<p>Inspector: His Lordship was more intoxicated than the
others.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>Mr. Lushington (falling on his knees, and holding up his
hands): I was not drunk this night&mdash;so help me, C---t.</p>
<p>The Inspector swore that none of the defendants were
sober.</p>
<p>Mr. Lushington: The case shall be carried to a higher
court.</p>
<p>Mr. Chambers: Then, to give you an opportunity of taking your
case elsewhere, I shall make you all find bail; and Mr. Young, if
he pleases, may prefer an indictment against you.</p>
<p>Mr. Chambers asked Mr. Lushington if he was a relative of Dr.
Lushington, <a name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a> and received a reply in the
affirmative.</p>
<p>Capt. Reynolds said, if his language had been offensive
towards the bench, he was sorry for having used it.</p>
<p>Mr. Chambers said, personally, he was indifferent to the
language used to him.</p>
<p>The parties having left the box, Mr. Young told Mr. Chambers
that he had no wish to press the case further.&nbsp; He wished an
arrangement could be made, so that the bench could decide the
matter summarily.</p>
<p>The defendants were acquainted with this very handsome conduct
on the part of the complainant, and, after some discussion, Capt.

<p>Lord Harley was fined 5/- for being intoxicated.</p>
<p>When Mr. Chambers was inflicting the latter fine, he said to
Lord Harley that he hoped he would exert his influence, if he had
any, with some members of the Legislature, to get the fine for
drunkenness increased to &pound;1 where the party was a

<p>The defendants paid the fines, and went away.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Thames Tunnel flooded&mdash;First mention of
the Nelson column&mdash;Moustaches&mdash;Sale of the King&rsquo;s
stud&mdash;Marriage by Registrar&mdash;Commencement of New Houses
of Parliament&mdash;Lunatics and the Queen&mdash;The
Queen&rsquo;s visit to the Guildhall&mdash;Lord
Beaconsfield&rsquo;s maiden speech.</p>
<p>Nowadays very little is thought of making a tunnel under the
Thames, but the first one, designed and carried out by Sir Marc
Isambard Brunel, was regarded, and rightly so, as a most
wonderful feat of engineering.&nbsp; One was proposed in 1799,
and a shaft was sunk in 1804, but the work went no further.&nbsp;
The one now spoken of was approved by Act of Parliament 24 June,
1824, and the shaft was begun and the first brick laid on 2
March, 1825.&nbsp; It suffered several times from irruptions of
water; one, on 18 May, 1827; another, in which six lives were
lost, on 12 Jan. 1828.&nbsp; In 1837 there were two irruptions,
the first taking place on 23 August, and it is thus described by
one of Brunel&rsquo;s assistants: &ldquo;We were at work about
two o&rsquo;clock on Wednesday, when we found the water coming in
faster than usual.&nbsp; At first, we observed a quantity of
loose sand falling near the gallery, which changed to thin, muddy
drops.&nbsp; This convinced us that the <i>stratum</i> in which
the men were working was bad, loose soil.&nbsp; The increase of
water made it necessary to withdraw the men, which was done by a
passage under the crown of the arch, made for their safety in
case of accidents.&nbsp; No injury was sustained by any of the
men.&nbsp; I was not satisfied, at the time, of the real extent
of the bad soil, and I ordered a boat to be brought, with a rope
of sufficient length to enable us to float to the shield.&nbsp;
The boat was brought, but the rope attached <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>to it, and by
which we were to be hauled into the shaft, was shorter than we
had ordered it.&nbsp; This deficiency probably saved our
lives.&nbsp; We had not proceeded far in the boat when I
perceived, by the twinkling of the lights in the tunnel, and
other indications of inundation, that the waters came in with
increased rapidity.&nbsp; I then gave the signal to be hauled
into the shaft, and had scarcely done so when I observed the
ground above give way, and the water descending in a thousand
streams, like a cascade, or the Falls of Niagara.&nbsp; We were
rescued, but, had the rope by which we were relieved from our
perilous situation been of a length to allow the boat to go to
the extremity of the tunnel, in all probability we should have
been drowned.&nbsp; This happened about four o&rsquo;clock, and,
soon after five, the tunnel was entirely filled.&nbsp; No lives
were lost.&nbsp; The only injury done is the suspension of the
works.&nbsp; The steam engine, when the leak is stopped, will
throw out a ton of water per minute; and, in three days and
nights, the whole of the tunnel may be pumped dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second irruption, on 3 Nov., also filled the Tunnel, but
on this occasion one man lost his life.</p>
<p>In the <i>Times</i> of 9 Sep. of this year I find the first
suggestion of a monument to Nelson, in Trafalgar Square:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir, I observe in your paper of Tuesday
last, that a correspondent has commented upon the proposed plan
for laying out Trafalgar Square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me to suggest through your columns the favourable
opportunity and most appropriate situation, now afforded, of
erecting in the centre of the Square some worthy trophy, or
statue, commemorating the glorious victories of the immortal
Nelson.&nbsp; Whilst other great commanders and statesmen are
honoured with suitable public monuments to their fame, surely the
British nation would be eager, if called on, to pay this tribute
to the valour, intrepidity and success of this illustrious
hero.&nbsp; Yours, etc.&mdash;J. B.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In those days every man went clean shaven, or only had side
whiskers, a full beard being unknown, and moustaches were
confined to foreigners and to a few cavalry regiments, so that
for a working man to sport them (although now so <!-- page
14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>exceedingly common) would probably lead to derision and
persecution, as in the following police case reported in the
<i>Times</i> of 21 Sep.:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Marlborough
Street</span>.&mdash;Yesterday, a young man, &ldquo;bearded like
the pard,&rdquo; who said he was a carpenter employed on the
London and Birmingham Railroad, applied to Mr. Rawlinson, the
sitting magistrate, for an assault warrant, under the following
ludicrous circumstances:</p>
<p>Mr. Rawlinson: What do you want the warrant for?</p>
<p>Applicant: I&rsquo;ll tell your worship, and you&rsquo;ll say
it&rsquo;s the most haggrawating and provoking thing as ever was
heard on.&nbsp; Veil, then, I goes to my vork, as usual, this
&rsquo;ere morning, ven one of my shopmates said to me,
&ldquo;Bill, you arn&rsquo;t shaved your hupper lip
lately.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mean it,&rdquo; says
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Vy?&rdquo; says he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Cos,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I intends vearing
mustachios to look like a gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Vell,
then,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;as you intends to become a
fashionable gentleman, p&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;ll have no
objection to forfeit half-a-gallon of ale, as it&rsquo;s a rule
here that every workman vot sports mustachios, to have them
vetted a bit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Veil, has I refused to have my
mustachios christened, they made game of them, and said they
weren&rsquo;t half fledged; and, more nor all that, they hustled
me about, and stole my dinner out of the pot, and treated me
shameful, and so I want your advice respecting my mustachios.</p>
<p>Mr. Rawlinson: My advice is, to go to a barber and have them
shaved off without loss of time.</p>
<p>Applicant: Can&rsquo;t part with a single hair.</p>
<p>Mr. Rawlinson: You want to look like a grenadier, I
suppose?</p>
<p>Applicant: My granny-dear (God bless her old soul!), she never
had such a fashionable and warlike appendage in her life.</p>
<p>Mr. Rawlinson: What business has a carpenter with a quantity
of long hair hanging from his lip?</p>
<p>Applicant: The reason vy I vears it is &rsquo;cos it&rsquo;s
fashionable, and makes me look like a man of some courage.</p>
<p>Mr. Rawlinson: Fashionable, indeed!&nbsp; I wish, with all my
<!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>heart, that the fashion was discontinued.&nbsp; Why need
an Englishman make a Jew of himself?&nbsp; It is disgusting to
see persons strutting through the streets with mustachios, and,
sometimes, a fringe of hair round the face and chin, which is
dignified by the name of whiskers.&nbsp; As you won&rsquo;t take
my advice, I can&rsquo;t assist you.</p>
<p>Applicant: Vot! not for striking me on the hupper lip?</p>
<p>Mr. Rawlinson: Then your mustachios must have saved you.</p>
<p>Applicant: No, they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Mr. Rawlinson: How&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Applicant: &rsquo;Cos the hair ain&rsquo;t long and thick
enough; they&rsquo;re only young &rsquo;uns as yet.&nbsp; There
was no occasion to strike me.</p>
<p>Mr. Rawlinson: And there&rsquo;s no occasion for you to wear
mustachios.&nbsp; You may have a warrant, if you like, but I
think you had better not.</p>
<p>The man with mustachios then withdrew.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The late King&rsquo;s stud at Hampton was doomed to be sold,
and the sale thereof created something of a sensation.&nbsp; On
this subject there is, in a little twopenny weekly magazine,
called <i>The Torch</i>, 9 Sep., &rsquo;37 (vol. i., p. 19), a
periodical now long forgotten, a poem by Tom Hood, which I have
not seen in any collection of his poems.&nbsp; It is a</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Petition to Her Majesty for Preserving
the Royal Stud at Hampton Court</span>.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">By Thomas
Hood</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">I.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liege Lady</span>, all the nation&rsquo;s

&nbsp;&nbsp; Which to preserve, should be your royal study.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">II.</p>
<p>Poor nags you would not in your stable find,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like cavalry of Evans called De Lacey,<br />
No!&nbsp; I do rather hope your royal mind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is naturally fond of something racy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>III.</p>
<p>Pray, what has Hampton done that you should trounce ill-<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; naturedly its prancers and its sport?<br />
You have a breed of <i>asses</i> in the <i>Council</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do keep a breed of <i>horses</i> in the

<p style="text-align: center">IV.</p>
<p>His truth who says that you should sell them, fails.<br />

<p>I daresay they believe they&rsquo;re very knowing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I think they&rsquo;re close to their official

And, when they set the horses &ldquo;Going, going,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nearly time they should be gone
themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">VII.</p>
<p>The nation quite in Hampton Court rejoices,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What! sell its stud of steeds beyond all praise!<br

<i>Nay</i>, shout the people with indignant voices,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the stud echoes with a hundred

<p style="text-align: center">VIII.</p>
<p>Then sell them not, dear lady, I implore ye;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of tears &rsquo;twill set your people shedding
floods;&mdash;<br />
I tell ye what will make &rsquo;em all adore ye,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Kick out your ministers and keep your bloods!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Hood must have laboured under a misapprehension, for the
horses were the private property of the late King, and his
executors had no option but to sell them.&nbsp; It was said that
William IV. in his lifetime wished the country to take the stud
over, at a valuation, and, after his death, it was offered to
Queen Victoria for &pound;16,000.&nbsp; The sale took place on
Oct. 25, and there were 80 lots, which did not fetch particularly
high prices, the highest being &ldquo;The Colonel,&rdquo; who was
bought, after winning the St. Leger, by George IV. for 4,000 <!--
page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>guineas; but the horse broke down after running a dead
heat at Ascot in 1831.&nbsp; He only realised 1,150 guineas, and
was bought by the auctioneer, Mr. Tattersall.&nbsp; The next
highest price given was for &ldquo;Act&aelig;on,&rdquo; which
fetched 920 guineas.&nbsp; The total proceeds of the sale was
15,692 guineas.</p>
<p>In October a great change was made in the matter of marriage,
which had, hitherto, been a purely ecclesiastical affair, but by
the 6 &amp; 7 Gul. iv., cap. 85, Registrars of births and deaths
were empowered to marry couples, and it became a purely civil
contract.&nbsp; This Act was to have come into force on the first
day of March; but a subsequent Act postponed it to the last day
of June, and it really only became effective in October.&nbsp; It
surprised people by its simplicity, and the gist of the Act is in
Section xx.: &ldquo;And be it enacted, That after the expiration
of the said Period of Twenty-one Days or of Seven Days, if the
Marriage is by Licence, Marriages may be solemnized in the
registered Building stated as aforesaid in the notice of such
Marriage, between and by the Parties described in the Notice and
Certificate, according to such form and ceremony as they may see
fit to adopt: Provided nevertheless, that every such Marriage
shall be solemnized with open doors, between the Hours of Eight
and Twelve in the Forenoon, in the Presence of some Registrar of
the District in which such registered Building is situated, and
of Two, or more, credible Witnesses; provided also, that in some
Part of the Ceremony, and in the Presence of such Registrar and
Witnesses, each of the Parties shall declare:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I do solemnly declare, That I know not of any
lawful Impediment why I, A. B., may not be joined in Matrimony to
C. D.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And each of the Parties shall say to the other:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I call upon these Persons here present to
witness that I, A. B., do take thee, C. D., to be my lawful
wedded Wife [or Husband].&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provided also, that there be no lawful Impediment to
the Marriage of such Parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old House of Commons was destroyed by fire on 16 Oct.,
1834, and it was not until September, 1837, that the <!-- page
18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>first
contracts for the commencement of the construction of the new
works, in connection with the present building, were entered
into.&nbsp; They were for the formation of an embankment 886 feet
in length, projecting into the river 98 feet further than that
then existing, to be faced with granite, and a terrace 673 feet
long next the river, and 35 feet wide, in front of the new
Houses, with an esplanade at each end 100 feet square, with
landing stairs from the river 12 feet wide.&nbsp; The whole
surface of the front building was to be excavated, and filled in
with concrete 12 feet thick, thus forming a permanent and solid
foundation for the superstructure.&nbsp; Towards the end of this
year, the Queen was somewhat pestered with lunatics.&nbsp; On
Nov. 4, as she was going through Birdcage Walk on her return from
Brighton, a man of respectable appearance went near the
Queen&rsquo;s carriage, held up his fist, and made use of most
insulting language towards Her Majesty and the Duchess of Kent,
declaring that the Queen was an usurper, and he would have her
off her Throne before a week was out.&nbsp; He was afterwards
arrested, and turned out to be Mr. John Goode, a gentleman of
large property in Devonshire, who had been previously in custody
on 24th of May (Her Majesty&rsquo;s birthday) for creating a
disturbance and forcibly entering the enclosure of Kensington
Palace.&nbsp; He was taken before the Privy Council, and when
examined, declared that he was a son of George IV. and Queen
Caroline, born at Montague House, Blackheath, and that, if he
could but get hold of the Queen, he would tear her in
pieces.&nbsp; He was told to find bail, himself in &pound;1,000,
and two sureties of &pound;500 each; but these not being
forthcoming, he was sent to prison.&nbsp; On entering the hackney
coach, he instantly smashed the windows with his elbows, and
screamed out to the sentinels: &ldquo;Guards of England, do your
duty, and rescue your Sovereign.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was, after a
very short imprisonment, confined in a lunatic asylum.</p>
<p>The other case was a German baker, but he only uttered threats
against the Queen and her mother, and he, too, was put in an
asylum.</p>
<p>A great event, and a very grand sight, was the Queen&rsquo;s
<!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>visit to the City of London on 9 Nov., when Alderman
Cowan inaugurated his mayoralty.&nbsp; The Queen went in State,
attended by all her Court, her Ministers, the Judges, etc.&nbsp;
The procession started from Buckingham Palace soon after 2 p.m.
and reached Guildhall about 3.30.</p>
<p>The interior of the Guildhall was &ldquo;exceeding
magnifical.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a canopy of carved gilt, with
draperies of crimson velvet and gold fringe and tassels, its
interior, being also of crimson velvet, was relieved by ornaments
in silver and a radiated oval of white satin with golden
rays.&nbsp; The back was fluted in white satin, enriched with the
Royal Arms in burnished gold.&nbsp; The State chair was covered
with crimson velvet with the Royal Arms and Crown, with the rose,
thistle and shamrock tastefully interwoven.</p>
<p>At each end of the Hall, the walls were covered with immense
plates of looking-glass.&nbsp; The window at the eastern end of
the Hall, above the throne, having been removed, a gigantic
wooden framework was substituted, on which was erected a gorgeous
piece of gas illumination.&nbsp; Above the mouldings of the
windows, and over the City Arms, waved the Royal Standard and the
Union Jack.&nbsp; Above was the Royal cypher, V.R., in very large
characters, surmounted by the appropriate word
&ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; the whole being encircled by an immense
wreath of laurels, which terminated, at the lower extremity of
the framework, with the rose, thistle and shamrock.&nbsp; Over
the clock at the western end, and reaching nearly the whole
breadth of the Hall, with Gog and Magog on the right and left,
was placed an immense stack of armour, with upwards of 30 furled
flags as an appropriate background.&nbsp; Immediately above was
the magnificently radiated star of the Order of the Garter,
surrounded by crimson drapery, and the scroll &ldquo;God save the
Queen&rdquo; entirely composed of cut glass, which, when lit up,
seemed, literally, one continued blaze of diamonds.&nbsp; The
whole was surmounted by the imperial crown and wreaths of laurel,
intermingled with the rose, thistle and shamrock, covering the
entire outline of the window.&nbsp; Where, formerly, was the
musicians&rsquo; gallery, on the opposite side, was occupied by
three stacks of armour; complete <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>coats of mail
were, likewise, suspended in other parts of the Hall; two knights
in complete armour guarded the entrance of the Hall and Council
Chamber, which latter was fitted up for the Queen&rsquo;s
reception room, and hung throughout with crimson fluted cloth,
finished with gold mouldings and festoons of red and white
flowers.&nbsp; Upon a platform stood a chair of state, splendidly
gilt and covered with crimson velvet, and there was no other
chair nor seat of any kind in the apartment.&nbsp; The
Queen&rsquo;s retiring-room was the Aldermen&rsquo;s Court, and
was superbly decorated, having a magnificent toilet table covered
with white satin, embroidered with the initials V.R., a crown and
wreath in gold, and looped with gold silk rope and tassels.</p>
<p>After the Queen&rsquo;s arrival at the Guildhall, and having
spent some little time on her toilet, her Majesty was conducted
to the Council Chamber, where&mdash;seated on her throne, and
surrounded by Royal Dukes and Duchesses, etc.&mdash;she listened
to a dutiful address read by the Recorder, and, at its
conclusion, she was graciously pleased to order letters patent to
be made out conferring a baronetcy on the Lord Mayor and
knighthood on the two Sheriffs, John Carroll and Moses
Montefiore, Esquires, the latter, as before mentioned, being the
first Jew who had received that honour.</p>
<p>At 20 minutes past 5 the Queen entered the Hall, in which was
the banquet, wearing a rich pink satin dress, ornamented with
gold and silver, a splendid pearl necklace, diamond earrings, and
a tiara of diamonds.&nbsp; She occupied the centre of the Royal
table, having on her right the Duke of Sussex, the Duchess of
Gloucester, the Duchess of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge
and the Duchess of Sutherland; and on her left, the Duke of
Cambridge, the Duchess of Kent, the Princess Augusta of Cambridge
and the Countess of Mulgrave.&nbsp; As a specimen of the
magnificence of this banquet, it may be mentioned that at the
Royal table the whole of the service was of gold, as were the
candelabra, epergnes, soup tureens, cellarets, etc.; one firm
furnished gold plate for the Queen&rsquo;s table and sideboard to
the value of &pound;115,000, and another firm nearly the same
amount, whilst the value of <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>plate lent by
various gentlemen was assessed at &pound;400,000, besides which
there was the Civic plate.&nbsp; The china dessert plates at the
Queen&rsquo;s table cost 10 guineas each, and all the glass
decanters and china were specially made for the occasion.</p>
<p>At 20 minutes past 8, the Queen left the Hall, and in her
retiring room was served with tea from a splendid gold service
made for the occasion, and she reached Buckingham Palace about
half-past 9&mdash;highly delighted with her entertainment.</p>
<p>There is nothing more of interest in this year, if we except
the maiden speech of Lord Beaconsfield, in the House of Commons,
which took place on 7th Dec.&nbsp; Mr. Disraeli (as he then was)
had the disadvantage of following O&rsquo;Connell, in a noisy
debate on the legality of the Irish Election Petition Fund.&nbsp;
He was not listened to from the first, and, in the middle of his
speech, as reported by <i>Hansard</i>, after begging the House to
give him five minutes, he said: &ldquo;He stood there to-night,
not formally, but, in some degree, virtually, as the
representative of a considerable number of Members of Parliament
(<i>laughter</i>).&nbsp; Now, why smile?&nbsp; Why envy
him?&nbsp; Why not let him enjoy that reflection, if only for one
night?&rdquo;&nbsp; All through his speech he was interrupted,
and this is its close, as reported in <i>Hansard</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When they recollected the &lsquo;new loves&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;old loves&rsquo; in which so much passion and
recrimination was mixed up between the noble Tityrus of the
Treasury Bench, and the learned Daphne of Liskeard&mdash;(<i>loud
laughter</i>)&mdash;notwithstanding the <i>amantium ira</i> had
resulted, as he always expected, in the <i>amoris
integratio</i>&mdash;(<i>renewed
laughter</i>)&mdash;notwithstanding that political duel had been
fought, in which more than one shot was interchanged, but in
which recourse was had to the secure arbitrament of blank
cartridges&mdash;(<i>laughter</i>)&mdash;notwithstanding
emancipated Ireland and enslaved England, the noble lord might
wave in one hand the keys of St. Peter, and in the
other&mdash;(<i>the shouts that followed drowned the conclusion
of the sentence</i>).&nbsp; Let them see the philosophical
prejudice of Man.&nbsp; He would, certainly, gladly hear a cheer
from the lips of a popular opponent.&nbsp; He was not at all
surprised at the reception which he had experienced.&nbsp; He had
begun several things many times, and <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>he had often
succeeded at last.&nbsp; He would sit down now, but the time
would come when they would hear him.&nbsp; (<i>The impatience of
the House would not allow the hon. member to finish his
speech</i>; <i>and during the greater part of the time the hon.
member was on his legs</i>, <i>he was so much interrupted that it
was impossible to hear what the hon. member said</i>).&rdquo;</p>

23</span>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Destruction of Royal Exchange&mdash;Sale of
the salvage&mdash;Spring-heeled Jack and his pranks&mdash;Lord
John Russell&rsquo;s hat.</p>
<p>As a sad pendant to the Civic festivities at the close of 1837
comes the destruction by fire of the Royal Exchange on the night
of the 10th of January following.</p>
<p>It was first noticed a little after 10 p.m., when flames were
observed in Lloyd&rsquo;s Coffee Room in the north-east corner of
the building, opposite the Bank, the firemen of which
establishment were soon on the spot, as well as many other of the
metropolitan engines.&nbsp; But, before any water could be thrown
upon the building, it was necessary to thaw the hose and works of
the engines by pouring hot water upon them, as the frost was so
very severe; so that, by 11 p.m., all Lloyd&rsquo;s was a mass of
flame.&nbsp; Nothing could be done to stop the conflagration, it
having got too great a hold, and great fears were entertained
that it would spread to the Bank and surrounding buildings, the
which, however, was fortunately prevented.&nbsp; The Lord Mayor
was present, and a large body of soldiers from the Tower assisted
the Police in keeping the crowd away from the immediate
scene.</p>
<p>It must have been a magnificent sight, and somewhat curious,
for amidst the roar of the flames, and until the chiming
apparatus was destroyed, and the bells dropped one by one, the
chimes went on pealing &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nae luck about the
house,&rdquo; <a name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a> &ldquo;Life let us cherish,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;God save the Queen.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fire was not
completely got under until noon the next day, but, practically,
the building was destroyed by 5 am., and, <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>so bright was
the conflagration, that it was visible at
Windsor&mdash;twenty-four miles off, and at Theydon, in Essex, a
distance of eighteen miles; whilst from the heights of Surrey on
the south, and Highgate and Hampstead on the north, the progress
of the fire was watched by crowds of people.</p>
<p>The following account of the Exchange after the fire is taken
from the <i>Times</i> of 13 Jan.:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Yesterday afternoon the ruins of the
Exchange were sufficiently cooled to allow the firemen and a
party of gentlemen, amongst whom we noticed the Lord Mayor, Mr.
Alderman Copeland, several members of the Gresham Committee, and
other persons connected with the mercantile interest, to inspect
them.&nbsp; In consequence of the loose fragments of stone work
belonging to the balustrades and ornamental parts of the building
being covered over with ice, the difficulty of walking over the
ruins was very great, and the chief magistrate fell more than
once, receiving sundry bumps.&nbsp; The lofty chimnies standing
appeared to be in such a dangerous condition, that they were
hauled down with ropes, to prevent their falling on the people
below.&nbsp; The iron chests belonging to the Royal Exchange
Assurance Company could be distinctly seen, from the area,
inserted in the walls.&nbsp; Ladders were raised, and they were
opened, when it was discovered that their contents, consisting of
deeds and other papers connected with the Company and their
insurances, were uninjured.&nbsp; This afforded much satisfaction
to the directors.&nbsp; Another iron safe, belonging to Mr.
Hathway, whose office, under the tower, was consumed, which was
also in a recess in the wall, was opened at the same time, and a
considerable sum in francs and bank-notes was taken out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The walls of the west wing of the building, which
seemed to bulge outward, were shored up in the afternoon, and
they are not, now, likely to fall.&nbsp; Cornhill presented a
most desolate appearance, the shops, from Finch Lane to the
termination of the street near the Mansion House, were all
closed, and the place presented a deserted and desolated
appearance; which, contrasted with the bustle hitherto observed
during business hours, and the sight of the ruins, forced very
unpleasant <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>reflections on the mind.&nbsp;
Barriers were placed at the Mansion House end of Cornhill, and
across that part of the street between Finch and Birchin Lanes,
and no person was allowed to pass except the firemen and persons
on business.&nbsp; All the avenues leading to Cornhill were also
blocked up in like manner; and, at each barrier, police officers
and ward constables were placed to prevent people passing.&nbsp;
Various schemes were devised, by numerous individuals, to pass
these barriers, and sums were, occasionally, offered to the
police to be allowed to visit the ruins, but without
effect.&nbsp; The City police kept the thieves away by their
presence and activity, and the conduct of the people was,
yesterday, very quiet, forming a contrast with the disorder got
up by the swell mob on Thursday last.&nbsp; Those who viewed the
ruins at a distance appeared to wear an air of melancholy, and no
fire has occurred, for centuries, which has caused more universal
regret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On searching the ruins under the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s
Court Office, the great City seal was picked up, with two bags,
containing &pound;200 in gold, uninjured.&nbsp; On this discovery
being communicated to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, it caused much
gratification, it having been rumoured that the Corporation would
lose their Charter by the loss of the seal, but we did not hear
it explained how this could be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owing to the great body of fire underneath the ruins at
the north-east angle of the Exchange, it was impossible for the
firemen to ascertain, until a late hour, whether any injury had
been done to Lloyd&rsquo;s books, which were deposited in a large
iron safe inserted in the wall.&nbsp; Two engines had been
playing on it during the latter portion of the day.&nbsp; In the
presence of several of the Committee it was opened, when it was
discovered that the fire had reached the books, and partially
consumed them.&nbsp; In the drawers were cheques on the Bank of
England to a large amount, and also Bank of England notes to the
amount of, it is said, &pound;2,560.&nbsp; The notes were reduced
to a cinder, and, on the drawers being opened, the air rushing in
on the tender fragments blew them over the Exchange.&nbsp; They
were, however, very carefully <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>collected,
and the cinders of the notes were, with much trouble and caution,
put into a tin case, which was taken to the Bank, and the words
&lsquo;Bank of England,&rsquo; with the numbers and dates, were
distinctly traced.&nbsp; The amount will, in consequence, be paid
to the owners.&nbsp; From what information could be obtained from
the gentlemen who took possession of the box, and who were
understood to be underwriters, it was the usual custom of the
secretary not to leave any money or notes in the safe, but to
deposit the money in the Bank, which was done on the evening the
fire took place.&nbsp; The money and notes above mentioned, and
which were found in the safe, belonged to a subscriber who, on
the afternoon of Wednesday, asked permission to deposit his money
in the safe until the next day, which was acceded to by the
secretary.&nbsp; Some idea may be formed of his state of mind on
arriving at the Exchange on the following morning, to see it on
fire, and he was in a state of distraction until the finding of
the cinders of the notes yesterday, which has, in some measure,
calmed his feelings.&nbsp; The underwriters are severe sufferers,
having left sums of money, to a large amount, in their desks,
which, no doubt, will never be recovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the confusion on the discovery of the fire, in
removing some books from a room in the north-east corner, in
addition to &pound;500 in Bank of England notes, which were taken
to St. Michael&rsquo;s Church, twenty sovereigns, in a bag, were
thrown out of the windows.&nbsp; The bag broke, and the
sovereigns rolled about the pavement; they were all picked up by
the mob, who appropriated them to their own use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is firmly believed that the overheating of the
stoves caused the disaster which the nation has now to
deplore.&nbsp; Wednesday was an exceedingly cold day, and large
fires had been kept up from morning till night in the
building.&nbsp; There is no doubt the fire had been spreading, to
some extent, in Lloyd&rsquo;s rooms, long before it was seen in
the street.&nbsp; Some few months back, two watchmen were on the
premises all night, but, on the miserable plea of economy, they
were discharged, and the sacrifice of one of the finest buildings
in the Kingdom has been the consequence.&nbsp; We believe that
<!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>most of our cathedrals and large public buildings are
left without watchmen during the night, and we hope that the fate
of the Royal Exchange will bring about a change in this
respect.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The merchants, who used to congregate &ldquo;on
&rsquo;Change,&rdquo; were accommodated in the Guildhall, and the
members of Lloyd&rsquo;s met at the Jerusalem Coffee
House&mdash;but these arrangements were, afterwards,
modified.&nbsp; The Royal Exchange Insurance Coy. took Sir James
Esdaile&rsquo;s house, in Lombard Street.</p>
<p><i>Times</i>, 4 Ap., 1838:&mdash;&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">The Royal Exchange</span>.&mdash;Yesterday, the
first day&rsquo;s sale of the materials of the Royal Exchange
took place.&nbsp; It produced nearly &pound;2,000.&nbsp; The
porter&rsquo;s large hand-bell (rung every day at half-past four
p.m. to warn the merchants and others that &rsquo;Change ought to
be closed), with the handle consumed, and valued at 10/-, was
sold for &pound;3 3/-; the two carved griffins, holding shields
of the City arms, facing the quadrangle, &pound;35; the two busts
of Queen Elizabeth, on the east and west sides, &pound;10 15/-;
the copper grasshopper vane, <a name="citation27"></a><a
href="#footnote27" class="citation">[27]</a> with the iron
upright, was reserved by the Committee; the alto relievo, in
artificial stone, representing Queen Elizabeth proclaiming the
Royal Exchange, &pound;21; the corresponding alto relievo,
representing Britannia seated amidst the emblems of Commerce,
accompanied by Science, Agriculture, Manufactures, etc.,
&pound;30; the carved emblematical figures of Europe, Asia,
Africa and America, &pound;110.&nbsp; The sale of the remainder
of the materials, etc., it is understood, will take place in
about a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Mansion House Police Court, on 10 Jan., the Lord Mayor
announced that he had received five letters relative to an
individual who was going about the metropolitan suburbs
frightening females to such an extent that they were afraid to go
out at night, as they were met by a man, who, under different
disguises, would suddenly appear before them, and as suddenly
disappear with terrible bounds, which earned him the name of
&ldquo;Spring-heeled Jack,&rdquo; and he inspired such <!-- page
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>terror, that the recital of the victim had to be taken
with caution.&nbsp; Whoever he was, or why he so acted, was never
known, as he was never taken; but, certainly, robbery had no part
in his escapades, for he was quite content with paralysing the
poor women with fright.</p>
<p>The first facts I can gather about Jack are at the latter end
of 1837, at Barnes, where he appeared as a large white bull; at
East Sheen he was a white bear; he then visited Richmond, and
after having terrorised that town, he went to Ham, Kingston and
Hampton, where he was clad in brass armour, with large claw-like
gloves.&nbsp; Teddington, Twickenham and Hounslow were all
visited by him, and at Isleworth we hear of him wearing steel
armour, in which he seems to have been attired when seen at
Uxbridge, Hanwell, Brentford and Ealing.&nbsp; At Hammersmith he
took the form of a huge baboon, and as such was seen in the
moonlight, dancing at Kensington Palace, ever and anon climbing
over the forcing houses.&nbsp; He varied his localities
frequently, one day being at Peckham, another at St. John&rsquo;s
Wood, and anon at Forest Hill.</p>
<p>This about brings up to the time of its being mentioned by the
Lord Mayor, the consequence of which was that a Committee was
formed at the Mansion House for the purpose of receiving
subscriptions and deciding upon the best means of capturing this
erratic genius.&nbsp; Probably feeling that he had sufficiently
terrorised the districts before mentioned, he turned his
attention to the East end of London, and particularly favoured
Bow.&nbsp; A case is given in the <i>Times</i> of 23 Feb.&nbsp; A
gentleman named Alsop, living between Bow and Old Ford, appeared
before the police magistrate at Lambeth Street (then the Thames
Police Office) accompanied by his three daughters, one of whom
stated that at about a quarter to nine o&rsquo;clock on the
evening of the 21st February, 1838, she heard a violent ringing
at the front gate of the house, and, on going to the door to see
what was the cause, she saw a man standing outside, of whom she
enquired what was the matter.&nbsp; The person instantly replied
that he was a policeman, and said, &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake
bring me a light, for we have caught Spring-heeled <!-- page
29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Jack
here in the lane.&rdquo;&nbsp; She returned to the house, and
brought a candle, and handed it to the man, who was enveloped in
a large cloak: The instant she had done so, he threw off his
outer garments, and, applying the lighted candle to his breast,
presented a most hideous and frightful appearance, vomiting forth
a quantity of blue and white flame from his mouth, his eyes
resembling red balls of fire.&nbsp; From the hasty glance which
her fright enabled her to get at his person, she observed that he
wore a large helmet, and his dress, which appeared to fit him
very tightly, seemed to her to resemble white oilskin.&nbsp;
Without uttering a sentence, he darted at her, and catching her
partly by her dress and the back part of her neck, placed her
head under one of his arms, and commenced tearing her clothes
with his claws, which she was certain were made of some metallic
substance.&nbsp; She screamed out as loud as she could for
assistance, and, by considerable exertion, got away from him, and
ran towards the house to get in.&nbsp; Her assailant followed,
and caught her on the doorstep, when he again used considerable
violence, tore her neck and arms with his claws, as well as a
quantity of hair from her head; her story was fully corroborated
by her parents and sisters, and her injuries, which were very
considerable, bore unmistakable testimony to the truth of the
assault.</p>
<p>At the same police court, on 8 Mar., 1838, a Miss Scales
deposed that as she and her sister were walking in Limehouse,
about half-past eight in the evening, on coming to Green Dragon
Alley, they observed some person standing in an angle in the
passage.&nbsp; She was in advance of her sister at the time, and
just as she came up to the person, who was enveloped in a large
cloak, he spirted a quantity of blue flame right in her face,
which deprived her of sight, and so alarmed her, that she
instantly dropped to the ground, and was seized with violent
fits, which continued for several hours.&nbsp; In this case no
violence to the person was done.</p>
<p>He had a literature of his own.&nbsp; I know of three
pamphlets on the subject; one, from which is taken the
accompanying illustration, is entitled &ldquo;Authentic
particulars of the awful <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>appearance of
the London Monster, alias Spring-heeled Jack, together with his
extraordinary life, wonderful adventures and secret amours.&nbsp;
Also an account of his horrible appearance to Miss N--- and his
singular letter to the Lord Mayor of London.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>There is much more to be related of Jack, but space will not
permit; but, whether too much attention was beginning to be paid
to him with a view to his capture, or whether his love of
mischief had died out, cannot be told; but certain it was that
nothing was known publicly of this singular being after April,
1838, having kept London in a ferment of excitement and terror
for about six months.</p>
<p>There is an amusing police case anent Lord John
Russell&rsquo;s hat.&mdash;<i>Times</i>, 8 Feb.:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Thames Police
Court</span>.&mdash;Yesterday, a poor woman, named Mary Ann Blay,
who stated that she resided at Limehouse, applied to Mr.
Ballantyne and Mr. Broderip, the magistrates, to request their
interference under very odd circumstances.&nbsp; <!-- page
31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>The
applicant stated that, about three or four months ago, she was on
her way home from Poplar, where she had been purchasing some
vegetables, when she saw something black lying on the
ground.&nbsp; She first supposed it was a piece of coal, but, on
stooping to pick it up, discovered it was a hat.&nbsp; She walked
onward, with the hat in her right hand, until she reached the
Commercial Road, when she was met by a policeman, who asked her
where she had got the hat.&nbsp; She informed him that she had
picked it up at the corner of the New Road, and the policeman
looked at it, and saw the name of Lord John Russell in the
inside.&nbsp; He demanded the hat of her, and, on her refusing to
give it up to him, he seized the hat, and took her into
custody.&nbsp; She was locked up in the station houses and, on
the following morning, was brought before the sitting magistrate
at that office.&nbsp; The justice, after hearing the
policeman&rsquo;s statement, directed her to be discharged, and
gave orders that the hat should be detained for a certain time,
in the station house; and, if no owner was discovered, that it
should be given up to her.&nbsp; She had, since, made repeated
inquiries of the police, but could obtain no information from
them, nor any redress for the false imprisonment she had
suffered.</p>
<p>Mr. Ballantyne asked the applicant if she was sure the hat
belonged to Lord J. Russell.</p>
<p>The woman said there had been a whitebait Cabinet dinner at
Mr. Lovegrove&rsquo;s, West India Dock Tavern, Blackwall, on the
night she found the hat, and Lord John Russell was one of the
party.</p>
<p>Mr. Ballantyne: Well, I don&rsquo;t understand how his
Lordship could lose his hat at the corner of the New Road.</p>
<p>The woman said it was supposed that Lord J. Russell had put
his head out of the carriage window, and looked back to see if
his friends were following him, when his hat fell off his head,
and, as he was a Lord, he would not stop until it was picked up
again (laughter).</p>
<p>Mr. Ballantyne: What do you want me to do in the matter?</p>
<p>The applicant said she wanted to know to whom the hat
belonged.</p>
<p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>Mr. Ballantyne: Why, I should say it belonged to Lord
John Russell.</p>
<p>The woman said the hat was worth a guinea, and that if she had
accepted 5/- from the policeman, and given it up to him, he would
not have taken her into custody.&nbsp; She thought it was very
hard to be subject to such tyranny because she had picked up Lord
John Russell&rsquo;s hat, for she had done no harm to the crown
of it.&nbsp; She supposed Lord John Russell was in liquor, or he
would have ordered his carriage to stop, and picked up his
hat.&nbsp; (Roars of laughter, in which the magistrates could not
help joining.)&nbsp; &ldquo;You may laugh,&rdquo; said the woman;
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s all true what I say; you may depend upon
it, the Ministers don&rsquo;t eat whitebait without drinking
plenty of wine after it, you may be sure.&nbsp; (Increased
laughter.)&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why the gentlemen laugh, I am
sure.&nbsp; I was locked up all night away from my husband and
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ballantyne said it was very singular the woman could not
recollect what night it was she picked up the hat, and the number
and letter of the policeman who took her into custody.</p>
<p>The applicant said she was too much alarmed at being locked up
in the station house, and brought before the magistrate, to
recollect what night it was, or the policeman&rsquo;s
identity.</p>
<p>Mr. Ballantyne said it was a very odd affair, and he would
direct the books to be searched to ascertain when the woman was
brought before the magistrate.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, the woman was again brought up.</p>
<p>Mr. Ballantyne said, it appeared from the minutes that she was
brought before him on Tuesday, the 3rd of October last, on
suspicion of stealing a hat, and that the policeman said that he
had stopped her at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning with the hat
in her possession.&nbsp; It appeared that he had discharged her,
but no mention was made of the hat belonging to Lord John
Russell.&nbsp; If that fact had been mentioned to him, he would
have ordered the hat to be restored to his Lordship
immediately.</p>
<p>The Applicant: I am sure it is his Lordship&rsquo;s hat.&nbsp;
There is Lord John Russell inside of it, quite plain; it&rsquo;s
a new one.</p>
<p><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>Mr. Ballantyne: Very well; an inquiry shall be made
about the hat, and you can attend here to-morrow, and we will let
you know what has become of it.&nbsp; I think Lord John Russell
has the best claim to the hat, if he has not already got it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sequel:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Times</i>, 10 Feb.:&mdash;On Thursday, Mary Ann
Blay again appeared before Mr. Ballantyne upon the subject of
Lord John&rsquo;s hat.&nbsp; She adhered to her old story, that
the hat had the noble Home Secretary&rsquo;s name in it when she
picked it up, but it had, subsequently, been torn out, after it
was taken out of her possession.&nbsp; Mr. Ballantyne examined
the hat, and said it was a dirty, greasy hat&mdash;a boy&rsquo;s
hat, and that he would not give 6d. for it.&nbsp; The policeman
who took the woman in custody declared that the woman&rsquo;s
statement was, altogether, a fabrication, and that the hat never
had the name of Lord John Russell in it.&nbsp; Mr. Ballantyne
said he would make no order about the hat; and, if the woman
thought she had been wrongly imprisoned, she might seek her
remedy elsewhere.</p>

<p>I must give another police case, as showing the manners and
customs of the <i>jeunesse dor&eacute;e</i> of this period.</p>
<p><i>Times</i>, 19 Feb.:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Marlborough
Street</span>.&mdash;On Saturday, Samuel Evans, better known as
&ldquo;Young Dutch Sam,&rdquo; a pugilist, was brought before Mr.
Conant, charged with having committed an unprovoked and violent
assault on policeman Mackenzie, C 182, and Lord Waldegrave was
also charged with attempting to rescue Evans from the police.</p>
<p>The defendant Evans, when sober, is civil and well-conducted,
but, when drunk, is one of the most dangerous ruffians connected
with the prize-fighting gang.&nbsp; Lord Waldegrave is a very
young nobleman, with a fund of native simplicity in his
countenance, rendered the more conspicuous by the style of dress
he had adopted, namely, a large coloured shawl round his neck,
and a rough pilot coat.&nbsp; Both parties exhibited
unquestionable proofs of the effect of their previous
night&rsquo;s potations.</p>
<p>Policeman Mackenzie, who had his arm in a sling, made the
following statement: About a quarter-past six that morning, after
he had come off duty, he went to the Standard public house, in
Piccadilly, for the purpose of getting some refreshment, but, on
perceiving some of the saloon frequenters there, to whom he was
personally obnoxious, in consequence of having taken disorderly
persons of their acquaintance into <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>custody, he
was about to go back, when he found himself suddenly pushed into
the house, with sufficient violence to cause his cape to fall
off.&nbsp; While engaged in folding up his cape, the defendant
Evans said, &ldquo;Will any gentleman like to see a policeman put
on his back?&rdquo;&nbsp; Complainant had not exchanged a single
word with anybody; he, however, found himself suddenly and quite
unexpectedly seized by the defendant, who had come behind him,
and then thrown with violence upon the floor; the defendant Evans
fell upon him at the same time; and, as complainant lay almost
stunned and unable to rise, some persons called out
&ldquo;Shame!&rdquo;&nbsp; Complainant was then helped up and
assisted out of the house.&nbsp; He went immediately to the
station house, and mentioned what had occurred to Inspector
Beresford, who instantly sent a sufficient force to take the
offenders into custody.&nbsp; Complainant went and pointed out
Dutch Sam to his comrades, and the defendant was taken into
custody.&nbsp; Lord Waldegrave, who was in the pugilist&rsquo;s
company, declared the police should not take his friend, and he
attempted to prevent the police from doing their duty.&nbsp;
Complainant, feeling his shoulder pain him very much, went to the
surgeon, and, by that gentleman&rsquo;s advice, proceeded to the
Charing Cross Hospital.&nbsp; When he was examined, it was
ascertained that one of the bones of his shoulder was broken.</p>
<p>Another policeman stated that Lord Waldegrave was very drunk,
and, when his Lordship attempted to resist the police, he was,
accidentally, thrown down on the pavement, and witness picked him
up.</p>
<p>Lord Waldegrave: He! he! he!&nbsp; Picked me up, did
you?&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; He! he! he!</p>
<p>Mr. Conant: This is no laughing matter, I can tell you; and it
is quite improper of you to make it a subject of merriment.</p>
<p>Lord Waldegrave: He! he! he!&nbsp; I beg pardon, but I
can&rsquo;t help laughing.</p>
<p>Mr. Conant asked Evans what he had to say in his defence?</p>
<p>Evans: Why, you see, Lord Waldegrave and me had been supping
together&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t we, my Lord?</p>
<p><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>Lord Waldegrave: Yes, we had.</p>
<p>Evans: And when we went into the public house there, we saw
the policeman, who was drunk, and who had been drinking purl in
the house.&nbsp; The policeman asked me to wrestle with him, and,
as I thought I could throw him, I accepted the challenge.</p>
<p>The Inspector proved that there was not one word of truth in
Evans&rsquo;s defence as far as regarded the sobriety of
Mackenzie.&nbsp; The assault took place within a few minutes
after Mackenzie had come off duty, and, certainly, before he
could have time to get refreshment.</p>
<p>The policeman declared what the defendant asserted was
entirely false.&nbsp; He had taken nothing to drink; and, as to
challenging a man like the defendant to wrestle, the assertion
was improbable.</p>
<p>Inspector Beresford, on being asked if he was certain Evans
was drunk, answered that he was decidedly drunk.</p>
<p>Evans: Silence, sweep, let a gentleman speak.&nbsp; I can get
a dozen oaths for half-a-crown.</p>
<p>Mr. Conant said the assault on the policeman was wanton and
unprovoked, and the matter was further aggravated by the fact
that a person of the defendant&rsquo;s well-known pugilistic
powers had chosen to attack an unoffending party.&nbsp; He
should, therefore, call on the defendant Evans to put in good
bail.</p>
<p>Evans: Serve his Lordship the same; for I like to have such a
pal.</p>
<p>Mr. Conant directed that Lord Waldegrave should be put back
until a second magistrate arrived.</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer having, soon afterwards, taken his seat on the bench,
Lord Waldegrave was placed at the bar.</p>
<p>Policeman Filmer, C 130, stated that he went with others to
the Standard public house, and took Evans into custody.&nbsp;
Lord Waldegrave threw his arms round his friend, and swore he
should not be taken.&nbsp; Witness swung his Lordship away, and,
in doing so, his Lordship fell down.&nbsp; Witness picked him up,
and would have let him go had his Lordship abstained <!-- page
37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>from
repeating his conduct.&nbsp; As he would not allow the police to
do their duty, he took him into custody.</p>
<p>Mr. Conant asked his Lordship what he had to say?</p>
<p>Lord Waldegrave: I have nothing to say.&nbsp; Perhaps I had
taken too much that night.</p>
<p>Policeman: His Lordship was very drunk.</p>
<p>Lord Waldegrave: Not very.</p>
<p>Mr. Conant: There has been no complaint of your conduct at the
station house, and I daresay your Lordship feels hurt at being in
the company of a person of the other defendant&rsquo;s
description.&nbsp; Taking into consideration the violence of the
outrage committed by Evans, as a warning, we must inflict a heavy
fine.&nbsp; You must, therefore, pay &pound;5 to the Queen.</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer: And because&mdash;in our summary
jurisdiction&mdash;we cannot go beyond that sum, we inflict it as
being the highest penalty in our power.</p>
<p>The sum was paid, and the noble defendant discharged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole social tone was low, from the highest to the lowest,
and if the police court gives us occasional glimpses of
aristocratic amusement, so it affords us a view of the
entertainments provided for the lower classes.&nbsp; Let us take
one.</p>
<p><i>Times</i>, 10 March:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Hatton
Garden</span>.&mdash;For some time past, numerous complaints have
been made to the magistrates of this office of two penny
theatres, one in Mortimer Market, Tottenham Court Road, and the
other in a field adjacent to Bagnigge Wells Road, where gangs of
young thieves nightly assembled.&nbsp; On Wednesday last, several
inhabitants of Mortimer Market attended at the Office to complain
of the former establishment, when Mr. Rogers granted a warrant to
apprehend the whole of the parties concerned, and on Thursday
night, Duke, Baylis and Halls, of this Office, in company with
Inspector Jenkins and a body of constables, proceeded to the
theatre, and captured the manager, performers, and musicians, and
the whole of them were, yesterday, brought to the office, and
placed at the bar, when the office was excessively crowded.</p>
<p><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>There were twelve prisoners, some of whom were attired
in their theatrical habiliments, with their countenances painted,
which made a very grotesque appearance.</p>
<p>Duke being sworn, stated that, in consequence of a warrant, on
Thursday night last, about 9 o&rsquo;clock, he proceeded, with
other officers, to a penny theatre in Mortimer Market, St.
Pancras, where he found the whole of the prisoners, some of whom
were engaged in performing their parts, whilst Ewyn, the manager,
was employed in taking money at the doors, and the woman, Green,
was acting as check taker.&nbsp; Campbell and Lewis were enacting
their parts upon the stage, and Joseph Burrows was in his
theatrical dress between them, with his face painted and wearing
a huge pair of moustaches.&nbsp; John Pillar was in a temporary
orchestra with a large violoncello, scraping away most
melodramatically, whilst the players were endeavouring to humour
the sounds, and to suit their action to the word, and the word to
the action; and just at that part of the performance when Burrows
had to exclaim, &ldquo;The officers of justice are coming,&rdquo;
witness and his brother officers rushed upon the stage, and
apprehended the whole of them.</p>
<p>Mr. Rogers: What description of audience was there?</p>
<p>Duke: A dirty, ragged set, principally consisting of boys and
girls; two of them were barefooted, and had scarce a rag to cover
them, and did not seem to have been washed for a month.&nbsp; The
theatre was of the most wretched description; there was a
temporary stage, and bits of scenery.&nbsp; The boys said they
were errand boys and servants.&nbsp; Brierly and Smith said they
were country actors out of an engagement, and had visited the
place out of curiosity.</p>
<p>Mr. Mallett: Had they an inscription that they were
&ldquo;Licensed pursuant to Act of Parliament&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Duke: They had not.&nbsp; On the gates was written up,
&ldquo;For this evening&rsquo;s performance The Spectre of the
Grave; after which, a comic song by Mr. Ewyn; to conclude with
The Key of the Little Door.&rdquo;&nbsp; They found various
theatrical dresses and other properties, with stars, swords,
etc., now produced.</p>
<p><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>Baylis proved having paid 1d. for admission.&nbsp; He
paid the money to the woman Green.&nbsp; Ewyn was at the door,
and he confessed that he was the manager.&nbsp; He took him into
custody, and, subsequently, he apprehended Lewis and Campbell, at
the back of the stage, in their theatrical dresses.</p>
<p>Mr. Rogers: Have you got &ldquo;The Spectre of the
Grave&rdquo; here?</p>
<p>Inspector Jenkins: No, your Worship, he vanished.&nbsp; The
other male performers were dressed in sandals and armour, with
their helmets up.</p>
<p>Hall and the other officers corroborated the above
evidence.&nbsp; Several inhabitants of Mortimer Market proved
that they were, every night, alarmed by firing off guns, cries of
&ldquo;Fire,&rdquo; clashing of swords, the most boisterous
ranting and shrieks from the voices of the ladies of the <i>corps
dramatique</i>, and the place was a perfect nuisance to the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The owner of the place stated that, on the 24th of January, he
let the place to a person named Summers, for chair making, when
it was turned into a theatre.</p>
<p>Ewyn said he had engaged with Summers to divide the profits of
the theatrical speculation.&nbsp; Summers agreed to take the
place, and he (Ewyn) to provide the scenery and wardrobe;
&ldquo;and proud I am to say, that I have conducted the consarn
respectably, which some of the neighbours can testify.&nbsp; This
is the head and front of my offending&mdash;no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspector Jenkins said that, about a month ago, he called on
Ewyn and cautioned him, but he said that the magistrates had
nothing to do with the matter.</p>
<p>Mr. Rogers, addressing the prisoners, said they had received a
warning which they did not heed.&nbsp; He should not order them
to find bail, but would discharge them; and, if they dared to
repeat their performances after this admonition, he would grant a
warrant for their apprehension, and every one of them should find
bail, or be committed.&nbsp; They held out temptation to the
children of poor persons, some of whom, it appears, were without
shoes and nearly naked, who robbed <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>their
parents, or others, for the purpose of procuring the penny for
admission.&nbsp; He would order their paraphernalia to be
restored to them, but, on condition that they would remove their
fittings, and desist from any future performances.</p>
<p>Ewyn: You must give me time to take down the seats and
decorations.</p>
<p>Mr. Rogers: You must take them down this day.</p>
<p>Ewyn (with a start): What! this day?&nbsp; Impossible.</p>
<p>Mr. Rogers directed Inspector Jones to see the mandate
obeyed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The month of April is famous for the inauguration of steam
traffic between England and America.&nbsp; A vessel named the
<i>Savannah</i> had in 1819 crossed from America to England, but
her steam was only intended to be auxiliary to her sailing power,
for her boilers had only a pressure of 20 lbs. to the square
inch.&nbsp; She sailed from New York on 28 Mar., 1819, reached
Savannah on 7 Ap., and anchored at Liverpool on 19 June; on her
return home her engines were taken out, and she was finally lost
off Long Island.&nbsp; In 1836 the Great Western Railway founded
the Great Western Steam Co., whose vessels were intended to run
from Bristol in co-operation with the railway, and the first ship
built was the Great Western, the largest steamer then
afloat.&nbsp; She was 236 feet long and her engines showed 750
indicated horse power, her registered tonnage being 1,300.&nbsp;
She was intended to be the pioneer ship, and was ready for sea in
April, 1838; but competition was as keen then as now, and the St.
Georges Steam Packet Coy. started their s.s. Sirius, for the
voyage to New York, from London, on the 29th March.&nbsp; She had
a tonnage of 700 tons, and her engines were of 320
horse-power.&nbsp; She was elegantly fitted-up, and started with
22 passengers, whose number was increased at Cork, and, being
intended solely for a passenger boat, carried no cargo.&nbsp; On
going down the Thames, she encountered her rival, the Great
Western, which had a pleasure party on board, and a trial of
speed took place between the two, resulting in favour of the
Sirius.&nbsp; She sailed from Cork on 9th April.&nbsp; The Great
<!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>Western sailed from Bristol on the 12th April, and both
reached New York on the same day, the Sirius being first.&nbsp;
The Great Western made, in all, 64 passages between the two
countries, her fastest passage occupying 12 days, 7&frac12;
hours.&nbsp; At the present writing, the record voyage for an
English steamer (the <i>Lucania</i>) is 5 days, 7 hours, 23
minutes.</p>
<p>The <i>Manchester Guardian</i> of 14th April gives an account
of a woman living in that city, who for many years passed as a
man, which has occurred before, but the extraordinary part of
this story is that she <i>married another
woman</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Subsequent inquiries confirm the truth of
the statements made in the <i>Guardian</i> of Wednesday last, as
to this singular case.&nbsp; This woman man, who, for probably
more than 25 years, has succeeded in concealing her sex, and in
pursuing a trade of more than ordinarily masculine and hazardous
description, with a degree of skill and ability which has led to
her establishment in a good business in this town, bound herself
apprentice, at the age of 16 or 17 years, to a Mr. Peacock, a
bricklayer and builder, at Bawtry, a small market town in the
West Riding of Yorkshire.&nbsp; She did not remain with Mr.
Peacock during the whole period of her apprenticeship, but was
&lsquo;turned over,&rsquo; as it is called, to another person in
the same business.&nbsp; It was during her apprenticeship that
she met with her present wife; and they were married at the old
parish church of Sheffield, in the year 1816, when the wife was
only 17 years old.&nbsp; Since the investigation and disclosure
of the circumstances, on Thursday week, the wife and husband have
separated.&nbsp; She was, for many years, a special constable in
the 13th division of that body, acting for this town; and we are
assured that, on all occasions when the services of the division
were required, as at elections, Orange processions, and meetings
of trades&rsquo; unions, turn-outs, etc., so far from absenting
herself from what, as in the case of well founded apprehension of
a riot, must have been, to a woman, a post of some
unpleasantness, she is remembered to have been one of the most
punctual in attendance, and the most forward volunteer in actual
duty, in that division.&nbsp; We <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>understand
that she is no longer a special constable, because she did not,
on the last annual special session, held for that purpose at the
New Bailey, present herself to be resworn.&nbsp; She was not
discarded or discharged; there was no complaint against her; and,
probably, the extension of her own business was her only motive
for not resuming the duties of this office.&nbsp; Altogether,
this is the most singular case of the kind which has ever reached
our knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following is an advertisement which appeared in the
<i>Times</i> of 27th April:&mdash;&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Nelson Monument</span>.&mdash;The Committee for
erecting a Monument to the Memory of Lord Nelson hereby give
notice that they are desirous of receiving from architects,
artists, or other persons, <span class="smcap">Designs</span> for
such a <span class="smcap">Monument</span>, to be erected in
Trafalgar Square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Committee cannot, in the present state of the
subscriptions, fix definitely the sum to be expended, but they
recommend that the estimated cost of the several designs should
be confined within the sums of &pound;20,000 and
&pound;30,000.&nbsp; This condition, and that of the intended
site, are the only restrictions to which the artists are
limited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same newspaper of 16 May, we read of a punishment which
might, occasionally, be revived with advantage, as being less
dangerous than the ducking stool, and, probably, quite as
efficacious, although we have the authority of St. James,
&ldquo;For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents,
and of things of the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of
mankind, but the tongue can no man tame.&rdquo;&nbsp; It relates
how, &ldquo;at the Mayor&rsquo;s Court, Stafford, last week,
Mary, wife of Thomas Careless, of the Broad Eye, a perfect
termagant, was ordered to pay 1/- penalty, and 7/6 costs, for an
unprovoked assault on Mary, the wife of Lewis Bromley.&nbsp;
During the investigation, her garrulity was so incessant that the
mayor was under the necessity of sending for the
&lsquo;scold&rsquo;s bridle,&rsquo; an iron instrument of very
antique construction, which, in olden times, was occasionally
called into use.&nbsp; It is formed of an elliptical bow of iron,
enclosing the head from the lower extremity of one ear to the
other, with a transverse piece of iron from the nape of the neck
to the mouth, and completely <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>covers the
tongue, preventing its movement, and the whole machinery, when
adjusted, is locked at the back of the head.&nbsp; The bridle is
to be put in thorough repair, and hung <i>in terrorem</i> in the
Mayor&rsquo;s office, to be used as occasion may call it
forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These &ldquo;scold&rsquo;s bridles,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;branks,&rdquo; as they are sometimes called, are not
uncommon.&nbsp; The earliest dated one is preserved at
Walton-on-Thames, and bears the date 1633, with the
inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Chester presents Walton with a bridle,<br
/>
To curb women&rsquo;s tongues that talk to idle.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brayley, in his &ldquo;History of Surrey,&rdquo; says that it
was given by a gentleman named Chester, who lost a valuable
estate through a gossiping, lying woman; but, as there are
several examples of branks in the Palatinate, one being kept in
the gaol at Chester, some people think it was a present from that
city.&nbsp; There is one at Leicester, and another at
Newcastle-on-Tyne, which used to hang in the mayor&rsquo;s
parlour, and tradition has it that many cases of disputes between
women have been speedily and satisfactorily settled on his
worship&rsquo;s pointing to these branks.</p>
<p>There is one in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, which is very
tender as far as the gag is concerned, but which has a leading
chain fastened between the eyes.&nbsp; Hainstall, Ridware,
Lichfield, Morpeth, Shrewsbury, Holme, Kendal, Altrincham,
Macclesfield, Congleton (where it was last used in 1824), all
have examples, whilst Chester has four!&nbsp; There are several
in Scotland, and there are some in private hands, notably one
which used to be in the Mayer Museum, Liverpool, which came from
Warrington, where, however, the brank formerly used at Carrington
is preserved, and there are several
places&mdash;Newcastle-under-Lyne (now in the Mayer Collection),
Manchester, and others&mdash;where they have existed.&nbsp; There
is a very grotesque one in Doddington Park, which is a mask,
having eyeholes, and a long funnel-shaped peak projecting from
the mouth; and there are some very terribly cruel ones, <!-- page
44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>with
fearful gags; but these can scarcely come under scold&rsquo;s or
gossip&rsquo;s bridles.&nbsp; There was one at Forfar, with a
spiked gag, which pierced the tongue, and an even more severe one
is at Stockport; whilst those at Ludlow and Worcester are, also,
instruments of torture.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Thom, the religious fanatic&mdash;His riots
and death&mdash;Delusions of his followers.</p>
<p>From the earliest ages of Christianity <i>pseudo-Christoi</i>,
or false Christs, existed.&nbsp; Simon Magus, Dositheus, and the
famous Barcochab were among the first of them, and they were
followed by Moses, in Crete, in the fifth century; Julian, in
Palestine, <i>circa</i> A.D. 530; and Screnus, in Spain,
<i>circa</i> A.D. 714.&nbsp; There were, in the 12th century,
some seven or eight in France, Spain and Persia; and, coming to
more modern times, there was Sabbatai Zewi, a native of Aleppo,
or Smyrna, who proclaimed himself to be the Messiah, in
Jerusalem, <i>circa</i> 1666.&nbsp; A list of religious fanatics
would be a long one, but the <i>pseudo-Christos</i> of modern
times was, certainly, John Nicholl Thom, of St. Columb, Cornwall,
<i>alias</i> Sir William Percy Honeywood Courtenay, Knight of
Malta, and King of Jerusalem; who also claimed to be Jesus
Christ, in proof of which he shewed punctures in his hands, and a
cicatrice on his side.</p>
<p>He was first introduced to public notice in Michaelmas, 1832,
when he paid a visit to Canterbury, and took up his abode, for
some time, at the &ldquo;Rose Inn,&rdquo; where he was remarkable
for his eccentric behaviour, passing under the name of
Rothschild.&nbsp; His countenance and costume denoted foreign
extraction, while his language and conversation showed that he
was well acquainted with almost every part of the kingdom.&nbsp;
He often dressed in a fine suit of Italian clothing, and,
sometimes, in the gayer and more imposing costume of the
east.&nbsp; In December of the same year, he surprised the
inhabitants of Canterbury by proposing himself as a candidate
<!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>for the representation of that city in Parliament, under
the name of Sir W. P. H. Courtenay.&nbsp; His canvass proceeded
with extraordinary success; and, such were his persuasive powers,
that people of all ranks felt an interest in his society; some,
however, considered him insane, while others were of a contrary
opinion, and he did not succeed in his ambition.</p>
<p>He next got mixed up in a smuggling affair, H.M. sloop
<i>Lively</i> having captured a smuggling craft (the <i>Admiral
Hood</i>) off the Goodwin Sands.&nbsp; He attended the
examination of the smugglers before the magistrates at Rochester,
attired in a fancy costume, and having a small scimitar suspended
from his neck, by a massive gold chain.&nbsp; He defended one of
the men, who, despite his advocacy, was convicted.&nbsp; He then
offered himself as a witness, swore that he had seen the whole
transaction, that there was no smuggling, and that the
<i>Lively</i> was to blame.&nbsp; This the prosecution could not
stand; he was indicted for perjury, and was tried at Maidstone on
25 July, 1833.&nbsp; The sentence of the Court was imprisonment
and transportation, but, being proved to be insane, this was
commuted to confinement in the lunatic asylum, at Barming
Heath.&nbsp; After about four years spent in this establishment,
he was released, on security being given for his future good
behaviour.&nbsp; He then went to live at the residence of Mr.
Francis, of Fairbrook, in the neighbourhood of Boughton, near
Canterbury.&nbsp; Owing to some misunderstanding with the family,
he removed to an adjoining cottage, and, at the time of which I
write, he lived at a farm-house, called Bossenden farm, occupied
by a person named Culver.</p>
<p>The influence obtained, by this maniac, over the small farmers
and peasantry in his neighbourhood, is most astonishing.&nbsp;
They believed in all he told them; first that he should be a
great chieftain in Kent, and that they should all live rent free
on his land, and that if they would follow his advice, they
should have good living and large estates, as he had great
influence at Court, and was to sit at the Queen&rsquo;s right
hand, on the day of her Coronation.&nbsp; It would seem as if his
madness, then, was personal and political, but the religious
mania speedily developed itself.&nbsp; He told his deluded <!--
page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>followers that they were oppressed by the laws in
general, but more particularly by the new poor law; and called
upon them to place themselves under his command.&nbsp; Nearly 100
at once joined him, and as they marched through the neighbouring
parishes their numbers increased.&nbsp; It was then that he
proclaimed his divinity&mdash;assuring them that both he and they
were not only invincible, but bullet proof, and that they could
never die.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The following account, which appears to me to be the most
succinct of those I have seen, is from the <i>Times</i> of 1
June:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On Monday (28 May) they sallied forth from
the village of Boughton, where they bought bread, and proceeded
to Wills&rsquo;s house, near Fairbrook.&nbsp; A loaf was broken
asunder, and placed on a pole, with a flag of white and blue, on
which was a rampant lion.&nbsp; Thence they proceeded to
Goodnestone, near Faversham, producing throughout the whole
neighbourhood the greatest excitement, and adding to their
numbers by the harangues occasionally delivered by this ill-fated
madman.&nbsp; At this farm Courtenay stated that &lsquo;he would
strike the bloody blow.&rsquo;&nbsp; A match was then taken from
a bean stack, which had been introduced by one of the
party.&nbsp; They next proceeded to a farm at Herne Hill, where
Courtenay requested the inmates to feed his friends, which
request was immediately complied with.&nbsp; Their next visit was
at Dargate Common, where Sir William, taking off his shoes, said,
&lsquo;I now stand on my own bottom.&rsquo;&nbsp; By Sir
William&rsquo;s request, his party went to prayers, and then
proceeded to Bossenden farm, where they supped, and slept in the
barn that night.&nbsp; At 3 o&rsquo;clock, on Tuesday morning
they left, and proceeded to Sittingbourne to breakfast, where Sir
William paid 25s.; they then visited Newnham, where a similar
treat was given at the &lsquo;George.&rsquo;&nbsp; After visiting
Eastling, Throwley, Selwich Lees and Selling, and occasionally
addressing the populace, holding out to them such inducements as
are usually made by persons desirous of creating a disturbance,
they halted, in a chalk pit, to rest, and, on Wednesday evening,
arrived at Culver&rsquo;s farm, called Bossenden, <!-- page
49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>close
to the scene of action.&nbsp; Mr. Curling, having had some of his
men enticed from their work, applied for a warrant for their
apprehension.&nbsp; Mears, a constable, in company with his
brother, proceeded to Culver&rsquo;s house, when, on application
being made for the men alluded to, Sir William immediately shot
the young man who accompanied his brother in the execution of his
duty.&nbsp; Such was the excitement, and the desperate menaces of
Sir William and his party, that it became necessary for the
magistrates to interfere to put a stop to the proceedings, by the
capture of the ringleader of the party, from whose advice to his
followers the most serious consequences were likely to
ensue.&nbsp; At 12 o&rsquo;clock, they assembled at a place
called the Osier Bed, where every means were resorted to, to
quell the disturbance, but without success.&nbsp; Sir William
defied interruption to his men, and fired on the Rev. William
Handley, of Herne Hill, who, with his brother, was assisting to
take him into custody.&nbsp; They then made their way to
Bossenden Wood, where they lay in ambush; but, as no means
appeared to present themselves, by which the ringleader could
safely be secured, he being evidently mad, and in possession of
loaded firearms, threatening to shoot the first man who
interfered with him, it became necessary to apply for the
assistance of the 45th regiment, stationed in Canterbury
barracks.&nbsp; On the arrival of a detachment of this regiment,
they proceeded to the wood, where the party was awaiting their
arrival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few minutes previous to the attack, Sir William
loudly halloed to his companions, supposed for the purpose of
getting them prepared for the fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir William, on perceiving his opponents, advanced with
the greatest <i>sang froid</i>, and deliberately shot Lieutenant
Bennett of the regiment, before his own men.&nbsp; This
occasioned a return from the man covering his officer, who
advanced, and shot Sir William, who fell, and died
instantly.&nbsp; The excitement, at that period, occasioned by
each party losing its commander, caused a desperate attack, which
terminated in the death of ten persons, besides the brother of
the constable shot in the morning, and several others seriously
<!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>wounded, of some of whom little hopes are entertained of
their recovery.&nbsp; The weapons in the hands of the followers
of Sir William, were chiefly, if not altogether, heavy
bludgeons.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following, from a correspondent, goes far to show the
delusions shared by this maniac and his followers:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The mention of this lad&rsquo;s name,
reminds me that his mother is said to have done more than any
other person in the parish to foster and encourage the belief
which she herself entertained, that Thom was our blessed Redeemer
and Saviour.&nbsp; So steadfast was she in her belief, that when,
after the battle in the wood, a neighbour went to tell her
&lsquo;the awful news,&rsquo; that Thom was killed, and her own
son wounded, she would not credit the information.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Sir William killed!&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;no, no, you
can&rsquo;t kill him; it is not the truth, it is not
possible.&rsquo;&nbsp; The reply to her was: &lsquo;It is the
truth, and it is possible.&rsquo;&nbsp; She again asserted that
it was not possible.&nbsp; Again the reply was: &lsquo;It is
possible, and it is as true as that your poor boy has got a shot
in his thigh.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, and not till then, would she
credit that her son was hurt.&nbsp; But as to Sir William, she
still remained incredulous, saying: &lsquo;Mind, three days will
show you and all the world what Sir William is.&nbsp; When that
time is elapsed, you will see whether he is not that which he
professes to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the general belief in the neighbourhood that he was
the Saviour, I saw a strong proof in some writing which I found
on the parsonage barn at Herne Hill.&nbsp; It has been there for
the last ten days, and is said to be in the handwriting of
Wills.&nbsp; On the left side of the door is written, in one long
line, these words, with spelling and capitals just as I have
copied them:&mdash;&lsquo;If you newho was on earth your harts
Wod turn&rsquo;; then in another: &lsquo;But dont Wate to
late&rsquo;; and then, in a third, &lsquo;They how
R.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the right side of the door is the following:
&lsquo;O that great day of gudgment, is close at hand&rsquo;; in
another: &lsquo;it now peps in the dor every man according to his
woks&rsquo;; and in a third: &lsquo;Our rites and liberties We
Will have.&rsquo;&nbsp; I mentioned some of them in a former
communication.&nbsp; At one of the places where he <!-- page
51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>ordered provisions for his followers, it was in these
words: &lsquo;Feed my sheep.&rsquo;&nbsp; To convince his
disciples of his divine commission, he is said to have pointed
his pistol at the stars, and told him that he would make them
fall from their spheres.&nbsp; He then fired at some particularly
bright star; and, his pistol having been rammed down with tow
steeped in oil, and sprinkled over with steel filings, produced,
on being fired, certain bright sparkles of light, which he
immediately said were falling stars.&nbsp; Again, in the early
part of his progress on Monday, he went away from his followers
with a man named Wills, and two of the other rioters, saying to
them, &lsquo;Do you stay here, whilst I go yonder,&rsquo;
pointing to a bean stack, &lsquo;and strike the bloody
blow.&rsquo;&nbsp; When they arrived at the stack, to which they
marched with a flag, the flag bearer laid his flag on the ground,
and knelt down to pray.&nbsp; The others then put in, it is said,
a lighted match; but Thom seized it and forbade it to burn, and
the fire was not kindled.&nbsp; This, on their return to the
company, was announced as a miracle worked by the Saviour.&nbsp;
There is another of his acts, which he mentioned as one of the
proofs of his Divinity, that I confess myself at a loss to
understand.&nbsp; After he had fired one shot at the constable,
Mears, and subsequently chopped at him with his dirk, he went
into the house, seized a loaded pistol, and on coming out, said:
&lsquo;Now, am I not your Saviour?&rsquo;&nbsp; The words were
scarcely out of his mouth, when he pulled the trigger of his
pistol, and shot Mears a second time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He administered a parody on the blessed Sacrament, in bread
and water to his followers, before the encounter and harangued
them.&nbsp; He told them on this occasion, as he did on many
others, that there was great opposition in the land, and, indeed,
throughout the world, but, that if they would follow him, he
would lead them on to glory.&nbsp; He told them he had come to
earth on a cloud, and that, on a cloud, he should some day be
removed from them; that neither bullets nor weapons could injure
him, or them, if they had but faith in him as their Saviour: and
that if 10,000 soldiers came against them, they would either turn
to their side, or <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>fall dead at his command.&nbsp; At
the end of his harangue, Alexander Foad, a respectable farmer,
and one of his followers, knelt down at his feet and worshipped
him; and so did another man named Brankford.&nbsp; Foad then
asked Thom whether he should follow him in the body, or go home
and follow him in heart.&nbsp; To this Thom replied:
&ldquo;Follow me in the body.&rdquo;&nbsp; Foad then sprang on
his feet in an ecstasy of joy, and, with a voice of great
animation, exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh, be joyful!&nbsp; Oh, be
joyful!&nbsp; The Saviour has accepted me.&nbsp; Go on&mdash;go
on, till I drop, I&rsquo;ll follow thee!&rdquo;&nbsp; Brankford
was also accepted as a follower, and exhibited the same
enthusiastic fervour, while Thom uttered terrific denunciations
of eternal torture in hell fire against all who should refuse to
follow him.</p>
<p>With the death of Thom and his deluded followers, the
excitement calmed down, and entirely subsided after the trial of
nine prisoners, which took place at Maidstone, on the 9th of
August, before Lord Denman.&nbsp; They were charged on two
counts: first, with aiding and abetting John Thom, <i>alias</i>
Courtenay, in the murder of Nicholas Mears, on the 31st of May,
and second, with being principals in the murder.&nbsp; Lord
Denman charged the jury that, if they were of opinion that Thom
was of unsound mind, so that, if he had been put upon his trial,
he could not have been convicted of murder, the principal being
acquitted, the accessories must also be acquitted, and the
prisoners could not be found guilty on the first count.&nbsp;
This, the jury acquiesced in, and brought in a verdict of
&ldquo;guilty&rdquo; on the second count, with a strong
recommendation to mercy on account of the infatuation under which
they were led astray by Courtenay.&nbsp; Lord Denman pronounced
sentence of death upon the prisoners, but added, that their lives
would be spared.&nbsp; Two were sentenced to transportation for
life; one to transportation for ten years; and the remainder to
be imprisoned for one year, and kept to hard labour in the House
of Correction, one month in solitary confinement.</p>

Marquis of Waterford&rsquo;s drive&mdash;His pranks at Melton
Mowbray&mdash;Steam carriages&mdash;Dog carriages&mdash;Grand
dinner at Guildhall.</p>
<p>The next event which occupied the public attention was the
Queen&rsquo;s Coronation, which took place on the 28th of
June.&nbsp; It was, like the &ldquo;Half Crownation&rdquo; of
William IV., a much plainer affair than that of George the
Magnificent, the walking procession of all the estates of the
realm, and the banquet in Westminster Hall, with all the feudal
services thereunto belonging, being wholly dispensed with.&nbsp;
The day began badly, with a cold shower about 8 a.m., but it
cleared off, and the sun shone out fitfully, throughout the time
the ceremony occupied&mdash;the head of the procession starting
from Buckingham Palace at 10 a.m., and the Queen reaching
Westminster Abbey at half-past eleven.&nbsp; Next to the Queen
herself, the principal attraction in the procession was the
equipages and liveries of the Ambassadors Extraordinary, chief
among which was the carriage of Marshal Soult (who represented
France), which had formerly belonged to the last great prince of
the House of Cond&eacute;, the father of the Duc de Bourbon, and
which, by its superior magnificence, eclipsed all other
vehicles.&nbsp; Besides which, it held the Duke of Dalmatia,
Wellington&rsquo;s old foe, who had now come to visit, in peace,
the country he had so manfully fought against.</p>
<p>Of the ceremony itself, I say nothing&mdash;everything was
done decorously and in order.&nbsp; It took a long time, for it
was a quarter to four when the royal procession reformed and took
its way through the nave of the abbey.&nbsp; The Queen
entertained a party of 100 at dinner; and, in the evening,
witnessed, <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>from the roof of her palace, the
fireworks discharged in the Green Park.&nbsp; The Duke of
Wellington gave a grand ball at Apsley House, for which cards of
invitation were issued for 2,000 persons.</p>
<p>As an indication of the numbers of people set down at the
Abbey, I may mention that the carriages which were ordered to
proceed (after setting down) to the south side of Westminster
Bridge, occupied a line from the bridge to Kennington Cross (more
than a mile).&nbsp; The carriages which were to proceed, after
setting down their company, to the west side of London, formed a
line nearly to Kensington (a mile and a half).&nbsp; Those
ordered to wait in the Strand extended, in double lines, to St.
Mary le Strand, and those directed to wait in Bird Cage Walk, St.
James&rsquo;s Park, occupied (in double rows) the whole line to
Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>There was a balloon ascent from Hyde Park, which was a
comparative failure, for it descended in Marylebone Lane, quite
done up with its short journey, and another sent up from
Vauxhall, which was more successful.&nbsp; There were grand
displays of fireworks in the Green and Hyde Parks, and all London
was most beautifully and brilliantly illuminated.</p>
<p>But the great thing was the Fair in Hyde Park, which had
official leave to exist for two days&mdash;but which, in fact,
lasted four.&nbsp; The area allotted to it comprised nearly one
third of the Park, extending from near the margin of the
Serpentine to within a short distance of Grosvenor Gate.&nbsp;
The best account I know of this Fair is in <i>The Morning
Chronicle</i> of 29 June, and I here reproduce it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of all the scenes which we witnessed,
connected with the Coronation, probably this was the most lively,
and that in which there was the least confusion, considering the
mass of persons collected together.&nbsp; Our readers are already
aware that the Fair was permitted to take place by the
Government, on the petition of the present holders of the show
which formerly belonged to the celebrated Richardson; and it was
to their care, together with that of Mr. Mallalieu, the
Superintendent of Police, that its general management was
entrusted.&nbsp; In justice to those gentlemen, we must say that
the arrangements <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>made for the accommodation of the
public were admirable, while they were carried out with the very
greatest success.&nbsp; The booths were arranged in a square
form, and covered a space of ground about 1,400 feet long and
about 1,000 feet broad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were arranged in regular rows, ample space being
allowed between them for the free passage of the people; and they
consisted of every variety of shape, while they were decked with
flags of all colours and nations.&nbsp; One portion of the fair
was set apart exclusively for ginger-bread and fancy booths,
while those rows by which these were surrounded were appropriated
to the use of showmen, and of persons who dealt in the more
substantial articles of refreshment.&nbsp; Of the latter
description, however, the readers would recognize many as regular
frequenters of such scenes; but, probably, the booth which
attracted the greatest attention, from its magnitude, was that
erected by Williams, the celebrated boiled beef monger of the Old
Bailey.&nbsp; This was pitched in the broadest part of the fair,
and immediately adjoining Richardson&rsquo;s show; and, at the
top of it was erected a gallery for the use of those who were
desirous of witnessing the fireworks in the evening, and, to
which, access was to be procured by payment of a small sum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While this person, and the no less celebrated Alger,
the proprietor of the Crown and Anchor, were astonishing the
visitors with the enormous extent of the accommodation which they
could afford the public, others set up claims of a character more
agreeable to the age in the exceedingly tasty mode in which they
had decorated their temporary houses.&nbsp; Of these, that which
struck us as most to be admired, was a tent erected by a person
named Bull, of Hackney, the interior of which, decorated with
fluted pillars of glazed calico, had a really beautiful
appearance.&nbsp; It would be useless, however, to attempt to
particularize every booth, for each held out its alluring
attractions to the gaping crowd with equal force, and each
appeared to be sufficiently patronized by the friends of its
proprietor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a few, in addition to the solid attractions of
eating <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>and drinking, held out those of a
more &lsquo;airy&rsquo; description, and, in many, it was
announced that a &lsquo;grand ball&rsquo; would be held in the
evening, &lsquo;to commence at six o&rsquo;clock&rsquo;; whilst,
in others, bands of music were heard &lsquo;in full play,&rsquo;
joining their sweet sounds to the melodious beatings of gongs and
shouting through trumpets of the adjoining shows.&nbsp; In
attractions of this kind we need only say that the fair was, in
most respects, fully equal to any other at which we ever had the
good fortune to be present, whether at Greenwich, or Croydon, or
in any other of the suburban or metropolitan districts.&nbsp;
Beef and ham, beer and wine, chickens and salad, were all equally
plentiful, and the taste of the most fastidious might be pleased
as to the quality, or the quantity, of the provisions provided
for him.&nbsp; In the pastry cooks&rsquo; booths, the usual
variety of gingerbread nuts, and gilt cocks in breeches, and
kings and queens, were to be procured; while, in some of them,
the more refined luxury of ices was advertised, an innovation
upon the ancient style of refreshment which we, certainly, had
never expected to see introduced into the canvas shops of the
fair pastry cooks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While these <i>marchands</i> were holding out their
various attractions to the physical tastes of the assembled
multitude, the showkeepers were not less actively employed in
endeavouring to please the eye of those who were willing to enjoy
their buffooneries, or their wonders.&nbsp; Fat boys and living
skeletons, Irish giants and Welsh dwarfs, children with two
heads, and animals without any heads at all, were among the least
of the wonders to be seen; while the more rational exhibition of
wild beasts joined with the mysterious wonders of the conjuror
and the athletic performances of tumblers, in calling forth
expressions of surprise and delight from the old, as well as from
the young, who were induced to contribute their pennies &lsquo;to
see the show.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor were these the only modes of procuring amusement
which presented themselves.&nbsp; On the Serpentine river a
number of boats had been launched, which had been procured from
the Thames, and watermen were employed, during the whole day, in
rowing about those who were anxious to enjoy <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>the
refreshing coolness of the water after the turmoil and heat of
the fair.&nbsp; Ponies and donkeys were in the outskirts of the
fair, plentiful, for the use of the young who were inclined for
equestrian exercise, while archery grounds and throw sticks held
out their attractions to the adepts in such practices, and
roundabouts and swings were ready to gratify the tastes of the
adventurous.&nbsp; Kensington Gardens were, as usual, open to the
public, and not a few who were fearful of joining in the crowd,
contented themselves here, in viewing the gay scene from a
distance.&nbsp; Timorous, however, as they might be, of personal
inconvenience, they did not fail to enjoy the opportunities which
were afforded them of looking into the book of fate; and we
observed many of the fairest parts of the creation busily engaged
in deep and private confabulations with those renowned seers, the
gypsies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With regard to those persons who visited the fair, we
must say we never saw a more orderly body.&nbsp; From an early
hour the visitors were flocking in; but it was not until Her
Majesty had gone to Westminster Abbey that the avenues
approaching Hyde Park became crowded.&nbsp; Then, indeed, the
countless thousands of London appeared to be poured forth, and
all seemed to be bound for the same point of destination.&nbsp;
Thousands who had taken up their standing places at Hyde Park
Corner, poured through the gate; whilst many who had assumed
positions at a greater distance from the Parks, passed through
the squares and through Grosvenor Gate.&nbsp; Every avenue was
soon filled, every booth was soon crammed full of persons
desirous of procuring refreshment and rest after the fatigue of
standing so long in the crowd to view the procession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These, however, were not the only persons who joined
the throng.&nbsp; Every cab, coach, or omnibus which had been
left disengaged, appeared to be driving to the same point, full
of passengers.&nbsp; Fulham, Putney, Mile End and Brixton alike
contributed their vehicles to carry the people to the Parks, and
thousands from the very extremity of the City were to be seen
flocking towards the Fair.&nbsp; All seemed bent on the same
object, that of procuring amusement, and work <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>seemed to
have been suspended, as if by common consent.&nbsp; While the
East-end thrust forth her less aristocratic workmen, the West-end
was not altogether idle in furnishing its quota to the throng,
and we noticed many really elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen
alight from their carriages to view the enlivening scene; and
many of them, who were, apparently, strangers to such
exhibitions, were, evidently, not a little amused at the
grotesque imitations of those amusements in which the aristocracy
delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carriages of every description were admitted into the
Parks, and the splendid carriage of an aristocrat was not
unfrequently followed by the tilted waggon of some remover of
furniture, with its load of men, women and children, who had come
to &lsquo;see the fun.&rsquo;&nbsp; All seemed, alike, bent on
amusement; all, alike, appeared to throw aside those restraints
which rank, fashion, or station had placed upon them, and to
enter fully into the enjoyment of the busy scene in which they
were actors.&nbsp; The delightful locality of the Fair, the
bright sunbeams playing upon the many-coloured tents, the joyous
laughter of the people, untouched by debauchery, and unseduced by
the gross pleasures of the appetite; the gay dresses of the
women, all in their best; joined in making the scene one which
must live long in the recollection of those who witnessed
it.&nbsp; All appeared to remember that this was the day of the
Coronation of a Queen, so youthful, so beautiful, so pure, and
all appeared to be determined that no act of insubordination or
of disorder on their part should sully the bright opening of a
reign so hopeful, and from which so much happiness is to be
expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have already said that the arrangements of the fair
were excellent; but, while these called forth our admiration, the
exceeding attention paid to the public by the police force
appeared to prevent the possibility of accident or robbery.&nbsp;
All gambling booths and thimble riggers had, of course, been
necessarily excluded, but we fear it was not possible to shut out
all those persons whose recollection of the laws of <i>meum</i>
and <i>tuum</i> was somewhat blunted.&nbsp; We heard of numerous
losses of small sums, and of handkerchiefs and other trifles,
<!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>but, throughout the day, we gained no information of any
robbery which was of sufficient extent to produce more than a
temporary inconvenience to the person robbed.&nbsp; A temporary
police station was erected in the grounds, in which Mr. Mallalieu
and a considerable portion of his men were in attendance during
the day; but, although there were, necessarily, some cases in
which slight acts of intemperance were visible, nothing of any
serious importance occurred during the whole of the early part of
the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The orderly conduct of the people, which we have
already described as having been observable during the morning,
was maintained through the rest of the day.&nbsp; Notwithstanding
that the crowd, at three o&rsquo;clock, had increased tenfold, no
disturbance nor riot occurred.&nbsp; The return of Her Majesty
attracted a few from the crowd, but nearly every one returned,
and all remained for the grand attraction of this part of the
day&rsquo;s amusement&mdash;the fireworks.&nbsp; As evening
closed in, the fatigue of the people rendered rest, as well as
refreshment, necessary, and every booth was, in a short time,
crowded with eager inquiries for eatables and drinkables.&nbsp;
The dancing booths were crowded to suffocation, and the viands of
the purveyors of grog were soon put into requisition.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next day was stormy and wet at first, but afterwards
turned out fine, and the Fair was crowded.&nbsp; On the third
day, a booth caught fire, but no great damage was done.&nbsp; On
the fourth, and last day, the Queen drove as close to it as she
well could do, and all the booths were cleared away that
night.</p>
<p>The Marquis of Waterford still continued his mad pranks, and
he was brought before Mr. Dyer, the Magistrate at Marlborough
Street, on 30 June, charged with being drunk and disorderly in
Piccadilly at 5 o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>Policeman Ellis, C 91, saw the Marquis, with two or three
other persons and a woman in his cab, driving down the Haymarket,
and committing the insane freak of making the foot pavement his
road.&nbsp; The policeman had no hope of overtaking the Marquis,
from the speed at which his lordship was driving; he, however,
followed as fast as he could, and, <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>when the
Marquis turned into Piccadilly, he saw his lordship again pull
his horse on the pavement, and drive on, to the imminent danger
of foot passengers.&nbsp; The cab went against some posts, and
this brought the horse to a standstill.&nbsp; The policeman ran
up, and after much difficulty and opposition on the part of the
Marquis&rsquo;s friends, he succeeded in lodging his lordship in
the station house.&nbsp; His lordship was too drunk to allow his
being enlarged on bail.</p>
<p>In explanation, the Marquis said he had a young horse in his
cab, which was very difficult to drive.&nbsp; The animal, having
a heavy load behind him, became unmanageable, and went, in spite
of all he could do, on the pavement.</p>
<p>The policeman, in the most positive manner, said he saw the
Marquis pull his horse upon the foot pavement, and whip the
animal to make him go the faster.</p>
<p>The Marquis declared, &ldquo;upon his honour,&rdquo; he did
not go more than five yards upon the pavement.</p>
<p>The policeman declared the Marquis drove about 100 yards on
the pavement in the Haymarket, and about 100 yards more upon the
pavement in Piccadilly.&nbsp; The concussion against the post was
so great, that the woman was thrown six yards out of the cab.</p>
<p>Marquis: I was thrown out myself.&nbsp; The fact is, I
consider this charge to be quite unwarranted.&nbsp; No one was
hurt, and the policeman exceeded his duty in taking me to the
station house.</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer: The policeman states you were intoxicated.</p>
<p>Marquis: Why, I had been about all night, and I don&rsquo;t
think I was very sober.</p>
<p>Policeman: You had your collar and shirt open, and your chest
was quite exposed.</p>
<p>Marquis: I was dressed just as I am at present.</p>
<p>Policeman: Your coat is now buttoned up; it was not so when I
took you in charge.&nbsp; You said, when I took you, you would
defy your brother to drive your horse.</p>
<p>Marquis: I might have said so because none of my brothers are
in town.&nbsp; But the horse is only four years old, has never
<!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>had a collar on before, and I&rsquo;ll defy any man to
drive him the length of this street.</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer: It was the more imprudent on your lordship&rsquo;s
part to bring such an unsafe animal into the public streets,
especially at the present time, when the streets are more than
usually thronged.&nbsp; Have you any witnesses?</p>
<p>Marquis: Yes, I can bring them, but I had rather not.</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer: If they can allege anything in contradiction of the
charge of wilful driving on the footpath, I am willing to hear
it.</p>
<p>Marquis: No.&nbsp; It will be a fine, I suppose, and I had
rather pay it than trouble my friends to come forward.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll call my horse, if your Worship thinks proper.</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer then inflicted a fine of 40s.</p>
<p>The Marquis paid the money, and, turning to the policeman,
made some unhandsome remarks on his evidence.</p>
<p>Mr. Dyer said the policeman bore an excellent character, and,
as far as the magistrates could judge, had always done his duty
fairly and respectably.</p>
<p>The Marquis took the arm of his friend, the Earl of
Waldegrave, and left the office.</p>
<p>We hear of him again very shortly afterwards, for on 31 July,
at Derby assizes, came on an indictment charging the Marquis of
Waterford, Sir F. Johnstone, Hon. A. C. H. Villiers, and E. H.
Reynard, Esq., with a riot and assault.&nbsp; On the 5th April
were the Croxton Park races, about five miles distance from
Melton Mowbray.&nbsp; The four defendants had been dining out at
Melton on the evening of that day; and about two in the morning
of the following day, the watchmen on duty, hearing a noise,
proceeded to the Market Place, and near Lord Rosebery&rsquo;s
house saw several gentlemen attempting to overturn a caravan, a
man being inside; the watchmen succeeded in preventing this, when
the Marquis of Waterford challenged one of them to fight, which
the watchmen declined.&nbsp; Subsequently, hearing a noise in the
direction of the toll bar, they proceeded thither, and found the
gate keeper had been screwed up in his house, and he had been
calling out &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>On coming up with the gentlemen a second time, it was
observed that they had a pot of red paint with them, while one
carried a paint brush, which one of the constables wrested from
the hand of the person who held it; but, subsequently, they
surrounded the man, threw him on his back, and painted his face
and neck with red paint.&nbsp; They then continued their games,
painting the doors and windows of different persons; and, when
one of their companions (Mr. Reynard) was put in the lock up,
they forced the constable to give up the keys, and succeeded in
getting him out.&nbsp; The jury found the defendants (who were
all identified as having taken part in the affray) guilty of the
common assault, and they were sentenced to pay a fine of
&pound;100 each, and to be imprisoned till such fine be paid.</p>
<p>Motor cars are not the modern invention we are apt to imagine
them, except as regards the power used&mdash;which, until lately,
was always steam.&nbsp; As far back as 1769, a Frenchman, named
Cugnot, made a steam carriage which carried four people, and
attained a speed of two and a quarter miles an hour!&nbsp; But it
was unfortunate to its inventor&mdash;for it came to grief in a
street in Paris, and the unhappy man was imprisoned.&nbsp; In
England our engineers exercised their inventive power in making
steam carriages&mdash;Murdock in 1782, Watt in 1784, Symington in
1786&mdash;and others made models, but the first which actually
ran in England was made by Trevithick and Vivian in 1803, and
this, in the streets of London (which were very far from being as
good as they are now), attained a speed of eight or nine miles an
hour.&nbsp; Between the years 1827&ndash;34 there were numerous
steam carriages built and tried, proving more or less
successful.&nbsp; One made by Sir Goldsworthy Gurney ran for
three months in 1831 with passengers between Cheltenham and
Gloucester, while Hancock&rsquo;s steam omnibuses (carrying 14 to
16 passengers) ran in London pretty constantly during the years
1833&ndash;36, and often at a speed of 10 or 12 miles an hour;
some of his coaches ran long journeys, such as from London to
Brighton, and he was the most successful of all inventors in this
line, <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>unless we except Scott Russell, who,
in 1834, ran six steam coaches between Glasgow and Paisley.</p>
<p>We read in the <i>Standard</i> of 21 June, 1838, that
&ldquo;Yesterday afternoon, Hyde Park presented a more than
usually gay appearance, in consequence of a crowd of fashionables
being assembled to witness the trial of a newly-constructed steam
cab.&nbsp; Among the many splendid equipages were observed those
of the Dowager Duchess of Sutherland, the Marquis of Salisbury,
the Marquis of Northampton, the Earl of Winchilsea, Lord Howick,
Lord Holland, and many other distinguished personages.&nbsp;
About 3 o&rsquo;clock the object of attraction moved forward at a
slow pace from the old Foot Guard Barracks, Knightsbridge, and
threaded its way through the various vehicles into the Park,
passing through the centre gate of the triumphal arch, and
making, in the open space opposite the statue, several turns
within its own length.&nbsp; The vehicle after the date hereof,
will render themselves liable to be hours round the Park, and,
from the slight noise it made, the horses passing did not appear
to be frightened.&nbsp; The average speed of the cab was about
twelve miles an hour.&nbsp; The vehicle was guided by Mr.
Hancock, the inventor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, if mechanical science had advanced as far as motor cars,
we were, in other ways, still as backward as Belgium and Germany
are at the present, in using dogs as draught animals.&nbsp; This
practice had increased to such an extent that it was found
necessary to placard the walls of the metropolis with the
following notice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Notice is hereby given, that all
persons using dogs under carts or trucks, as beasts of burden,
after the date hereof, will render themselves liable to be
prosecuted, and fined &pound;2, according to the provisions of an
obsolete Act lately discovered.&nbsp; London, 18 Aug.,
1838.&rdquo;&nbsp; This scandal did not last long, for in
&ldquo;an Act for further improving the Police in and near the
Metropolis,&rdquo; 2 and 3 Vict., c. 47 [17 Aug., 1839], we find
that Section LVI. says, &ldquo;And be it enacted, That after the
First Day of <i>January</i> next, every person who, within the
Metropolitan Police District, shall use any Dog for the purpose
of drawing, or helping to draw any Cart, Carriage, Truck, or
Barrow, shall be liable to a <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>penalty of
not more than Forty Shillings for the first offence, and not more
than Five Pounds for the Second, or any following
offence.&rdquo;&nbsp; This act was extended to all parts of the
Kingdom by the 17 and 18 Vict., c. 60.</p>
<p>On the 13th July the Corporation of the City of London gave a
grand banquet, at the Guildhall, to the foreign Princes,
Ambassadors extraordinary, and <i>Corps Diplomatique</i>, then in
the metropolis, in honour of the Queen&rsquo;s Coronation; and in
order to completely divest the occasion of anything like a
political aspect, care was taken to invite, besides the
Ministers, an equal number of the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of both
parties in the State.&nbsp; The principal guests went in their
state carriages, and the streets were crowded with sightseers who
especially welcomed the Duke of Wellington and Marshal
Soult.&nbsp; The arrangements and decorations in the Hall were
almost the same as those used for the Royal banquet in the
previous November, the tables and sideboards were ablaze with
plate lent by the various City Companies, and the General Bill of
Fare was as follows:</p>
<p>One hundred and twenty tureens of turtle soup, of five pints
each; 17 dishes of fish, consisting of salmon, turbot, whitings,
tench and eels; 40 haunches of venison; 80 dishes of fowls,
capons and pullets; 40 cherry, gooseberry and currant tarts; 30
strawberry tarts; 40 dishes of potatos; 60 dishes of French
beans; 30 French pies; 30 pigeon pies; 30 hams; 30 tongues; 2
barons of beef; 37 Chantilly baskets; 30 dishes of peas; 10
sirloins, ribs and rumps of beef; 45 dishes of shell fish; 30
ribs, chines and legs of lamb; 40 dishes of ducklings; 20 turkey
poults; 80 jellies; 20 creams; 40 salads and cucumbers; 20 dishes
of cauliflowers.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Dessert</span>.&mdash;Seventy-five pine apples of
2lbs each; 100 dishes of hothouse grapes; 20 melons; 30 dishes of
cherries; 100 dishes of strawberries; 40 dishes of currants and
gooseberries; 120 cream and water ices, various; 40 dishes of
dried fruit; 35 ornamented Savoy cakes; 30 dishes of preserves,
biscuits and olives.</p>
<p>Marshal Soult stopped for some time in England, and visited
many of the manufacturing towns.</p>

65</span>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Genesis of &ldquo;The Charter&rdquo; - L.
&amp; N. W. Railway opened to Birmingham&mdash;Overland route to
India&mdash;A bold smuggler&mdash;Bull baiting&mdash;Visitors to
the Queen&mdash;&ldquo;The Boy Jones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Probably nearly all my readers have heard of the
&ldquo;Chartists,&rdquo; but it is equally probable that few know
when the agitation commenced, and the reason for its
existence.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Charter,&rdquo; as it was called, was
the Radical outcome of the Reform Bill of 1832.&nbsp; For a time,
after the passing of that Bill, the land had peace, for all
reasonable reforms had been granted, but the demagogues were not
going to be quietly annihilated, and an agitation for more
trenchant reform was got up, and a mass meeting in its favour was
held at Birmingham, on the 6th of August, and at it were
inaugurated the principles of &ldquo;The People&rsquo;s
Charter,&rdquo; as it was called.&nbsp; It is currently reported
that this &ldquo;Charter&rdquo; was drawn up by William Lovett, a
carpenter and cabinet maker, who took an active part in getting
rid of the stamp tax upon newspapers; and it is very likely that
it was so, for he drew up most of the petitions and addresses for
the movement, and, in connection with it, he, the following year,
suffered 12 months&rsquo; imprisonment.&nbsp; He died Aug.
1877.&nbsp; The demands of this &ldquo;Charter&rdquo; were six,
and they were familiarly known as the six points.&nbsp; They
were:</p>
<blockquote><p>Universal Suffrage.<br />
Vote by Ballot.<br />
Annual Parliaments.<br />
Payment of the Members.<br />
Abolition of the Property Qualification.<br />
Equal Electoral Districts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>The meeting was got up by T. Atwood, Esq., M.P., and the
site chosen for it was a large vacant piece of ground, at
Birmingham, on the north-west side of the town, and there
drinking booths galore were erected.&nbsp; The morning began very
wet, and the different divisions from the neighbouring country
marched bemired and bedraggled to the rendezous.&nbsp; There they
soon filled the drinking booths, in which they abode; hence,
probably, the very diverse statements as to the numbers present
at the meeting, which vary from 10,000 to 200,000.&nbsp; The
ground chosen was a natural amphitheatre, and, if the weather had
been finer, it would have been a pretty sight, enlivened by the
bright banners of the different Trades&rsquo; Societies.&nbsp;
However, Mr. Atwood read the Petition, which embodied the above
six points, and moved its adoption.&nbsp; Feargus O&rsquo;Connor,
a well-known firebrand, seconded it in a violent speech, in which
occurred the following balderdash.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;On with your green standard rearing,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Go, flesh every sword to the hilt;<br />
On our side is Virtue and Erin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On yours is the <i>parson</i> and guilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course the Motion was enthusiastically carried, and then a
very heavy shower of rain terminated the proceedings.&nbsp; The
petition was afterwards presented to Parliament by Mr. Atwood on
the 14th of June, 1839.</p>
<p>On 17th Sept the London and North Western Railway (then called
the London and Birmingham Rly.) was opened throughout to
Birmingham; the first train, containing Directors and their
friends, leaving Euston at 7.15 a.m.&nbsp; The times of this
train are useful for comparing with the present time.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The train left Euston at 15 minutes past 7, but did not
take on locomotive until 20 minutes past.&nbsp; It arrived at
Tring station at 25 minutes past 8, where there was five
minutes&rsquo; delay.&nbsp; Arrived at Wolverton at 6 minutes
past 9, where the directors alighted and changed engines.&nbsp;
The train arrived at Rugby at 11 o&rsquo;clock, where the Duke of
Sussex and his suite alighted, and proceeded by carriage to the
place of his destination.&nbsp; The directors remained at Rugby
10 minutes, <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>and arrived at Birmingham 3 minutes
past 12, having performed the whole journey, including stoppages,
in 4 hours 48 minutes, and, exclusive of stoppages, in 4 hours 14
minutes.&nbsp; This is, unquestionably, the shortest time in
which the journey from London to Birmingham has ever been
performed, being upwards of two hours less than the time occupied
by Marshal Soult and attendants a few weeks ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fare for one person from London to Birmingham, or
back, by the &lsquo;four inside&rsquo; carriages, by day, or the
first class, &lsquo;six inside&rsquo; by night, will be &pound;1
12s. 6d; by the second-class carriages, open by day, which is the
cheapest, it will be &pound;1.&nbsp; The intermediate fares will
be &pound;1 10s. and &pound;1 5s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not generally known that the two lodges at the entrance
of Euston Station, were the original ticket office and waiting
room.</p>
<p>People were beginning to wake from the torpor in which they
had hitherto slumbered, with regard to locomotion, and on 12th
October an influential meeting of merchants and others was held
at the Jerusalem Coffee House to hear a Captain Barber unfold his
scheme for a quicker communication with India.&nbsp; This was
that passengers and goods should be taken by steam to Cairo, and
thence, by omnibuses and vans to Suez&mdash;as was afterwards
done by Waghorn, who was already forming an Overland Mail (see
<i>Times</i>, 29 Nov., 1838).</p>
<p>With the very heavy duties on foreign goods, of course
smuggling was very rife, and the Inland Revenue was defrauded on
every possible occasion by the sharp wits opposed to it; and the
difficulty of conviction, unless the smuggler was caught
red-handed, was very considerable.&nbsp; The following is a case
in point, and for sheer impudence, it bears the palm.&nbsp; 17
Oct.:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Mansion House</span>.&mdash;A
Scotchwoman, named Frances Bodmore, the wife of a Frenchman, who
has been engaged in smuggling, appeared to answer for her
husband, on a charge of having two two-gallon bottles of French
brandy in his possession, without having paid the duty
thereon.</p>
<p><!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>Child, the constable, said he went into the house of the
Frenchman, in Sugarloaf Court; and, while searching for other
things, found the bottles under the pillows of the bed.</p>
<p>The Lord Mayor: Why don&rsquo;t your husband attend?</p>
<p>Woman: Why, because he knows nothing at all about the
business.&nbsp; I think he&rsquo;d be a great fool to come here
without knowing for what.</p>
<p>The Lord Mayor: How do you get your living?</p>
<p>Woman: Why, as well as I can.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t get it
without running some risk for it, you may depend.</p>
<p>The Lord Mayor: We know you to be a consummate smuggler.</p>
<p>Woman: Whatever my business may be, I generally get through it
like a trump.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no nonsense about me.</p>
<p>The Lord Mayor (to the Revenue officer): She is constantly
backward and forward between this and France, I daresay.</p>
<p>Woman: Yes, my Lord, I travel a good deal for the benefit of
my health, and I always come back stouter than I go.&nbsp;
(Laughter.)</p>
<p>Officer: She&rsquo;s perfectly well known, my Lord, as one of
a number that are commissioned by parties in London.&nbsp; They
are all very clever, and elude us in every possible way, and the
steamers afford them great facilities.</p>
<p>The Lord Mayor: I can&rsquo;t send this woman to prison, and
she knows it well, but I shall punish every experienced smuggler
I catch as severely as I can.&nbsp; They cheat the fair trader,
they endanger the vessel in which they come over, and they cheat
the Government.</p>
<p>Woman: Ay, my Lord, that&rsquo;s the cleverest thing of
all.&nbsp; Only think of cheating the Government!&nbsp; Well,
well, I wonder where the villainy of man will end!&nbsp;
(Laughter.)</p>
<p>The Lord Mayor: Take care of yourself.&nbsp; You think you are
secure.&nbsp; You may go now.</p>
<p>Woman: Good morning, my Lord.&nbsp; Although you are so kind,
I hope I shall never have the pleasure of seeing your face
again.</p>
<p>The Lord Mayor was informed that great quantities of <!-- page
69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>lace
were brought over by women.&nbsp; Some had been found stitched up
in the skins of wildfowl, and there was scarcely an article, dead
or alive, that was not suspected of being a depository of
contraband goods.&nbsp; It was but a short time ago, that a
wretched-looking object was discovered to be the carrier of a
large stock of lace.&nbsp; He had an old bedstead, which, in his
trips to Boulogne, he used to take with him.&nbsp; At last,
somebody on board expressed his surprise, why a ricketty piece of
furniture, which looked as if it was the tenement of living
animals, should be so frequent a passenger.&nbsp; Upon close
examination, it was found that the several pieces of the bedstead
had been hollowed and stuffed with lace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cruel old English sport of bull baiting was still
continued at Stamford, in Lincolnshire, where it is said to have
existed since the year 1209, in the reign of King John.&nbsp; The
story goes that, in that year, William, Earl Warren, lord of the
town, standing on the walls of his castle, saw two bulls fighting
for a cow, in the castle meadow, till all the butchers dogs
pursued one of the bulls (maddened by the noise and multitude)
clean through the town.&nbsp; This sight so pleased the Earl,
that he gave the castle meadow, where the bulls&rsquo; duel
began, for a common, to the butchers of the town, after the first
grass was mown, on condition that they should find a mad bull the
day six weeks before Christmas Day&mdash;for the continuation of
that sport, for ever.</p>
<p>But the time had come for putting an end to this barbarous
practice, and it was this year put down by direct interference of
the Secretary of State.&nbsp; At Stamford, and elsewhere, it was
believed that this bull baiting was legal, being established by
custom; but the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
with a view of setting the question at rest by the decision of
the Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench, caused an indictment to be
preferred against several of the ringleaders.&nbsp; The
indictment was tried at Lincoln, before Mr. Justice Park and a
special jury, when several of them were found guilty; and, upon
their being brought up for judgment in the Court of Queen&rsquo;s
Bench, the Court unanimously declared the practice <!-- page
70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>to be
illegal; the Chief Justice, in particular, said: &ldquo;It was
supposed there was some matter of law&mdash;at first, there was a
supposed old Charter&mdash;for the future, it must be considered
as an illegal practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In consequence of this decision, a troop of the 14th Dragoons,
together with 12 Metropolitan policemen, were sent into the town
of Stamford.&nbsp; Placards, apprising the public of the
illegality of the bull baiting, were posted in the town and
neighbourhood, and the threatened and attempted repetition of
this barbarous scene was prevented without any loss of life or
serious injury.&nbsp; The <i>bullards</i> (as they were called)
mustered in strong numbers.&nbsp; They had provided two fierce
bulls to be hunted and tormented; but the bulls were seized and
pounded by the police; and, although the ruffian mob remained in
considerable numbers, no serious breach of the peace took
place.&nbsp; But they were determined not to be altogether
baulked of their <i>sport</i>; for a bull calf, enclosed in a
cart, and followed by its lowing mother, entered the town, and
was immediately seized on as a substitute for a bull.&nbsp; It
was taken out, and hunted through the town for some time, until
rescued by the police.</p>
<p>Every lunatic seems to have wanted to say something to the
young Queen, and visitors to Buckingham Palace were very
frequent, although the object of their wishes was never
attained.&nbsp; To show the nuisance involved by these fools let
me give one paragraph out of the <i>Times</i>, 19 Dec.:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Visitors to Her
Majesty</span>.&mdash;On Saturday night, about 9 o&rsquo;clock, a
very respectably dressed young man rang the bell at the
tradesmen&rsquo;s entrance of the new Palace, and, upon being
asked the nature of his business, he said he had come for the
direction of his house, as he was tired, and wished to go
home.&nbsp; Upon being asked to explain himself, he said he had
just come from Sydney, and had been desired to call at the Palace
by the Queen, who told him he should have a house to live in, and
&pound;150 a year, for some very important spiritual
communication he had made to her.&nbsp; The young man, whose
every action showed he was a lunatic, was <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>then told the
Queen was not in town, when he turned away, observing that he
would go immediately to Lord Hill, and lay his case before
him.&nbsp; Visits of the preceding kind are very frequent at the
Palace, and the tales told by the visitants are of the very
strangest nature.&nbsp; It is only a few weeks since, an elderly
man, having the appearance of a farmer, called at the Palace, and
handing to the porter the certificate of his birth, requested him
to let Her Majesty sign it.&nbsp; From inquiries made concerning
this man, it was discovered that he was a respectable farmer in
the neighbourhood of Exeter, from which distant place he had
wandered on so strange an errand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But of all visitors to the Royal Palace, <span
class="smcap">the Boy Jones</span> was the most frequent and
successful.&nbsp; Who, in this generation, knows anything about
<span class="smcap">the Boy Jones</span>?&nbsp; Yet his escapades
were very daring and his story is very true&mdash;but so strange
is it that, in order to be believed, I must, at least, in part,
give the chapter and verse for it:</p>
<p><i>The Times</i>, 15 Dec.:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Queen
Square</span>.&mdash;Yesterday, a lad about 15 years of age, who
gave his name as Edward Cotton, whose dress was that of a sweep,
but who was stated to be the son of a respectable tradesman in
Hertfordshire, was charged with being found in the Marble hall of
Buckingham Palace, under circumstances of an extraordinary
nature.&nbsp; It should be stated that Buckingham Palace, even
during the absence of the Queen, is guarded by the gentlemen
porters of the establishment, two inspectors of the A division of
police, and sentries from the Foot Guards.&nbsp; In spite of
this, a number of cases have lately occurred at this office,
where persons have been found in the interior of the Palace under
unaccountable circumstances.</p>
<p>George Cox, one of the porters, having been sworn, said, that
at five o&rsquo;clock yesterday morning he saw the prisoner in
the Marble hall.&nbsp; The latter endeavoured to make his escape
into the lobby, but he pursued him, and he then took <!-- page
72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>a
contrary direction, across the lawn at the back of the
Palace.&nbsp; Witness called for the sentry at the gate, and a
policeman of the B Division who was on duty in James Street,
caught the lad, after a long chase over the lawn.&nbsp; Mr. Cox
added, that he found, in the lobby, a regimental sword, a
quantity of linen, and other articles, all of which had been
purloined from the Palace.&nbsp; The sword was the property of
the Hon. Augustus Murray, a gentleman attached to the
Queen&rsquo;s establishment.&nbsp; Witness went into that
gentleman&rsquo;s bedroom, and the bedding was covered with
soot.&nbsp; The prisoner had, evidently, endeavoured to get up
the chimney, in order to effect his escape; there was a valuable
likeness of Her Majesty, in the Marble hall, which was broken,
and covered with soot; and it was supposed that the lad, in the
first instance, had descended from the top of the building, and
had endeavoured to make his way back again in the same
manner.</p>
<p>James Stone, 31 B, deposed that he was called upon by the last
witness to secure the prisoner.&nbsp; There were marks of soot in
several of the bedchambers, as well as in one of the corridors of
the Palace, and the Grand (or Marble) hall.&nbsp; He found upon
him two letters, one addressed to Her Majesty, and the other to
the Hon. Mr. Murray.&nbsp; These letters had been placed
underneath Her Majesty&rsquo;s portrait, and had, no doubt, been
taken by the prisoner at the time the picture was
destroyed.&nbsp; Part of the scabbard of the sword was discovered
in one of the beds, and a quantity of bear&rsquo;s grease, part
of which he had placed upon his flesh, was taken from
him&mdash;it belonged to one of the servants of the Palace.&nbsp;
Upon being taken to the station house, he said he came from
Hertfordshire, and that his father was a respectable man.</p>
<p>Mr. White, the sitting magistrate, observed that it was a most
extraordinary thing that persons could get into the Palace under
such circumstances.</p>
<p>Several persons belonging to the Palace said that every
inquiry had been made, but it could not be accounted for.</p>
<p>Mr. White (to the prisoner): Where do you come from?</p>
<p>Prisoner: I came from Hertfordshire 12 months ago, <!-- page
73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>and I
met with a man in a fustian jacket, who asked me to go with him
to Buckingham House.&nbsp; I went, and have been there ever
since.&nbsp; I got my victuals in the kitchen, and I thought
myself very well off, because I came to London to better
myself.</p>
<p>Mr. White: Well, you could not go to a higher place.</p>
<p>Prisoner: I declare it to be the case, and I lived very
well.&nbsp; To be sure, I was obliged to wash my shirt now and
then.</p>
<p>Mr. White: You fared, then, altogether, pretty well?</p>
<p>Prisoner: Very well indeed, Sir, and I was always placed, when
the Queen had a meeting with the Ministers, behind a piece of
furniture in the room; but I, certainly, did live well.</p>
<p>Mr. White: Indeed!&nbsp; And which was your favourite
apartment?</p>
<p>Prisoner: The room in front of the gardens; but I was always
in the secret when the Ministers came.</p>
<p>Mr. White: Do you mean to tell me that you have lived in the
Palace upwards of 11 months, and been concealed when Her Majesty
held a Council?</p>
<p>Prisoner: I do.</p>
<p>Mr. White: Were you hid behind a chair?</p>
<p>Prisoner: No.&nbsp; But the tables and other furniture
concealed me.</p>
<p>Mr. White: Then you could hear all Her Majesty said?</p>
<p>Prisoner: Oh, yes! and her Ministers too.</p>
<p>The prisoner&rsquo;s answers to the questions of the
magistrate were given in the most shrewd manner possible, and he
evidently appeared to be a lad of some education, but nothing
further could be elicited from him.</p>
<p>Mr. White said it was a most singular affair, and that it
should be strictly inquired into.&nbsp; For the present, he
should remand the prisoner until Wednesday next.&nbsp; The
magistrate also told Cox that, as he should be sitting there
every day, he should be glad to receive any information upon the
subject.</p>
<p>The letters found upon the prisoner were directed to be sent
to the Palace, under seal of the Office, the prisoner having
broken them open.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>The case excited great interest, and, in the first
instance, was sent to Bow Street; but Sir Frederick Roe being out
of town, it was ordered to be heard at this office.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The Times</i>, 20 Dec.&mdash;Yesterday, the lad
found in Buckingham Palace, who had given his name as Edward
Cotton, and described himself as the son of a respectable
tradesman living in the town of Hertford, was brought before
Messrs. White and Gregorie for final examination.&nbsp; It will
be recollected that he had purloined, amongst other articles, two
letters, which were immediately sealed up, and sent back to the
Palace.&nbsp; The prisoner turns out to be the son of an
industrious tailor, named Jones, residing in York Street,
Westminster; and, it appears, had frequently expressed his
intention to enter the Palace, under any circumstances.&nbsp; He
had often stated that he wished to see the grand staircase, in
order to take a sketch of it, and had often expressed his
determination to see the Queen, and to hear her sentiments when
Her Majesty and her Ministers were assembled in Council.</p>
<p>Frederick Blume now deposed that he was valet to the Hon. Mr.
Murray, and that a sword, a quantity of linen and other articles,
had been stolen from that gentleman&rsquo;s apartments in the
Palace.</p>
<p>Mr. White: When were they stolen?</p>
<p>Witness: I can&rsquo;t recollect.</p>
<p>Mr. White: Was it a week, a month, or three or four months
ago?</p>
<p>Witness: I cannot say.</p>
<p>Mr. White: Where was your master&rsquo;s sword at the time you
saw it last?</p>
<p>Witness: When I went to Windsor.</p>
<p>Mr. White: When was that?</p>
<p>Witness: I cannot exactly recollect, and then he added, that
about a week since, he had sent from Windsor to the Palace, a
portmanteau containing his linen, and three pairs of trousers,
four of stockings, and three cravats were missing.&nbsp; The
padlock of the portmanteau had been forced by the sword having
been applied to it.&nbsp; The sword had broken in <!-- page
75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>the
attempt.&nbsp; He had also lost five 10 sous pieces, which had
been found upon the prisoner.</p>
<p>Mr. White: What is the value of the articles you have
lost?</p>
<p>Witness: I don&rsquo;t know; but I should like to give three
guineas to get them back.</p>
<p>Mr. White: Can you swear to the French coin found upon the
prisoner as being yours?</p>
<p>The witness was then shown the coin, and he said that he
certainly could.&nbsp; They had been taken from his bedroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Mr. White: Can any information be given as to the manner in
which the prisoner gained access to the Palace?&nbsp; Cox, one of
the porters to the Palace, said that the principal entrance door
was always locked, and the key in his possession.&nbsp; At 5
o&rsquo;clock on Saturday morning, just as he was about to get
out of bed, the prisoner opened the door of his room, as witness
considered, to obtain the key; his face and hands were disguised
with soot and bear&rsquo;s grease, and he was asked whether he
came to sweep a chimney: he did not make any answer, but
endeavoured to escape.</p>
<p>Inspector Steed, A division, said that upon examining the
gates of the principal entrance of the Palace, he found that, at
the Marble Arch, there was a vacuum sufficient to admit a boy
into the Palace, without any inconvenience.</p>
<p>Mr. White: And is there no sentry at this gate?</p>
<p>Witness: There are two.</p>
<p>The inspector said that he had examined the boy&rsquo;s boots,
and the gravel upon them corresponded with that lately laid down
close to the Marble Arch.&nbsp; The boots had been taken off by
the prisoner, and left in one of the apartments appropriated to
the use of the porters of the Palace.</p>
<p>Mr. Griffiths, builder, Coventry Street, said that the lad had
been in his employment for a few months; he had always expressed
his intention to get into the interior of the Palace by some
means or other; he was a clever lad, <!-- page 76--><a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>and had made
a sketch of the exterior, and a view of the enclosure fronting
the Palace.&nbsp; He had left his service two days since, and
witness was very much distressed, as were his parents, to know
what had become of him.&nbsp; Upon reading the accounts in the
newspapers, he immediately went to Tothill Fields, and identified
him, much to the gratification of his father, who supposed that
he had drowned himself, the latter having, on account of his
son&rsquo;s bad conduct, turned him out of doors.</p>
<p>The Magistrate, after telling the boy that he would, most
likely, be committed for trial, asked him what he could say in
his defence.</p>
<p>Prisoner: I wished to see the Palace, and I went in with a man
in a fustian jacket.&nbsp; I had the whole range of the Palace
for a day or two, but the money found upon me I picked up in one
of the rooms.</p>
<p>Mr. White: Tell me the truth, for I am about to send you for
trial.</p>
<p>Prisoner: Oh, very well; with all my heart.</p>
<p>He was fully committed to the Westminster Sessions, and all
parties bound over to prosecute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was tried on 28 Dec., and was most ably defended by his
Counsel, Mr. Prendergast, who turned everything to ridicule, and
the jury returned a verdict of Not Guilty, regarding the escapade
in the light of a youthful folly, and being, also, mindful of the
fact that the boy did not enter the Palace for the purpose of
theft.</p>
<p>But we shall hear of <span class="smcap">the Boy Jones</span>
again.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Death of Lord Norbury&mdash;Birth of

the Queen&rsquo;s marriage&mdash;Sad story of Lady Flora
Hastings&mdash;Story of a climbing boy&mdash;Van
Amburgh&mdash;Embanking the Thames&mdash;Victoria
Park&mdash;Robbery of gold dust.</p>
<p>In a book, professedly of Gossip, politics should be strictly
kept in the background&mdash;but at this time Ireland was
seething with sedition.&nbsp; Still I should hardly have adverted
to it, had not the deliberate and brutal murder of the Earl of
Norbury, on 1 Jan., set all tongues wagging.&nbsp; His Lordship
was walking in the shrubbery, near his own house at Kilbeggan, in
the county of Meath, talking to his steward, and pointing out to
him some trees he wished to have cut down, when some miscreant,
behind a hedge, fired a blunder-buss loaded with swan shot at
him, and he fell, mortally wounded.&nbsp; He lived for 43 hours
afterwards&mdash;but his assassin ran away and escaped; nor, in
spite of large rewards offered, was he ever discovered.</p>
<p>Photography may be said to have been practically born early in
this year, for, on 7 Jan., the French Academy reported on the
invention of M. Daguerre, by which the pictures of the camera
lucida were rendered permanent.&nbsp; All former attempts may be
regarded as scientific dilletanteism and nothing more.&nbsp; The
earliest known pictures caused by light on a sensitive surface
were made by Thomas Wedgwood (a son of Josiah, the famous
potter), whose researches were published in 1802 in the
<i>Journal of the Royal Institution</i>, under the title:
&ldquo;An account of a Method of copying Paintings upon Glass,
and making Profiles by the agency of Light upon Nitrate of
Silver: with Observations by H. Davy.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Afterwards, <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>came Nicephore Niepce, of
Ch&acirc;lon sur Sa&ocirc;ne, who produced permanent light
pictures in 1814, and he and Daguerre went into partnership in
this matter, in 1829.&nbsp; Fox Talbot was the first to invent a
negative photograph, and he read a paper on &ldquo;Photogenic
Drawings&rdquo; before the Royal Society, on 31 Jan., this year;
and that scientific investigation of the new wonder excited the
attention, even of amateurs, is shown by a letter in the
<i>Times</i> of 21 Feb.:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Seeing in a
newspaper, last week, that a German had found out M.
Daguerre&rsquo;s secret, I was so impressed with that testimony
to the possibility of <i>seizing a shadow</i>, that I thought
over all the little I knew of light, colours and chymistry.&nbsp;
The next day, I took a piece of writing paper, hastily prepared
by myself, placed it behind the lens of a <i>camera obscura</i>,
made on the spur of the moment, and obtained a satisfactory
result; for the trees, in front of my house, were produced, but
not the parts agitated by the wind.&nbsp; Since that, I have
obtained, progressively improving, several landscapes, which may
be called, most appositely, &lsquo;lucigraphs.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
mention my humble effort as corroborative of the reality, or
feasibility of M. Daguerre&rsquo;s beautiful discovery; and I can
readily conceive that, in a very short time, the
traveller&rsquo;s portmanteau will not be complete without the
very portable means of procuring a lucigraph at
pleasure.&mdash;Yours, etc., <span class="smcap">Clericus</span>,
Welney, Wisbeach.&rdquo;&nbsp; This gentleman&rsquo;s prophecy
has, long since, been verified, as the &ldquo;Kodakers&rdquo; all
over the world can testify.&nbsp; But the first public experiment
in England (if we exclude Wedgwood&rsquo;s) was made, on Sept.
13, 1839, when M. St. Croix exhibited the whole process of
Daguerreotype, in presence of a select party of scientific men
and artists.&nbsp; He also succeeded in producing a picture of
the place of meeting; No. 7, Piccadilly.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>People were beginning to wake up as to social improvements,
and the better paving of, at least, the most public
thoroughfares, was loudly called for.&nbsp; Hitherto people had
been content with the old cobble stones, and wide kennels, <!--
page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>or gutters&mdash;but henceforth there was to be
inaugurated a newer and better <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, as we learn
from the <i>Observer</i> of 6 Jan.:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Experimental Pavement
of Oxford Street</span>.&mdash;This, doubtless, the most
extraordinary and novel undertaking which has ever been attempted
in the annals of road making, is, to the gratification, not only
to the respectable inhabitants of Oxford Street, but to a curious
public, at last, completed.&nbsp; On Friday (4 Jan.) at 2
o&rsquo;clock, the line of this great thoroughfare, occupied by
the various specimens of paving, extending from Charles Street to
Tottenham Court Road, presented a most animated spectacle, being
thronged by thousands of spectators anxious to witness its
opening to the public.&nbsp; Shortly after 2 o&rsquo;clock, the
Paving Committee appointed by the Marylebone Vestry to
superintend the arrangement of this work of art, headed by the
parish beadles, in full uniform, with their maces; and
accompanied by the respective projectors and the parochial
authorities, arrived on the spot in procession, and passed over
the ground, followed by 21 omnibuses, after which, the road was
thrown open to the public.&nbsp; From time to time, during the
progress of the work, many erroneous statements have gone the
rounds of our daily contemporaries, with respect to the extent of
ground allotted to the experiments, and on other matters
connected with the arrangements.&nbsp; The following, however,
being obtained from an official source, may be fully relied upon
as correct: The whole space between Charles Street and Tottenham
Court Road is occupied by 12 different specimens, which are
completed in the following order, commencing at Charles Street:
viz.&mdash;40 feet of Robinson&rsquo;s Parisian bitumen&mdash;24
feet laid in straight courses, and 16 feet diagonally; 74 feet of
parish stone paving, 54 feet of which is laid in straight
courses, the stones 9 inches deep, and the interstices filled up
with Claridge&rsquo;s asphalte; the remaining 20 feet consisting
of stones only 4&frac12; inches deep, but laid diagonally, and
filled up with the same composition; 60 feet of the Bastenne and
Gaujac bitumen, partly laid in straight courses, and partly
diagonally: <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>135 feet of parish stone paving,
divided into three sections, in the following order&mdash;1st, 70
feet of dressed Aberdeen granite, with concrete bottom, and the
joints grouted with lime and sand; 2nd, 40 feet of the same, laid
diagonally; and 3rd, 25 feet of dressed Aberdeen granite, without
concrete bottom, the joints filled in with fine gravel; this is
followed by 50 feet of the Scotch asphaltum, which is entirely
the produce of this country, laid down in straight courses: 60
feet of Mr. Stead&rsquo;s pavement, of wooden blocks, of a
sexagonal form, 12 inches deep, divided into three compartments,
one prepared with Kyan&rsquo;s patent, part dipped in, and joints
run with asphalte, and part without any preparation whatever: the
last specimen, at Tottenham Court Road, is 60 feet of the Val de
Travers bitumen, a portion of which consists of square blocks,
laid in straight courses, and the remainder consisting of a layer
of clean Guernsey chippings cemented together by boiling
asphalte, run among them nearly to the surface, and a face made
with asphalte, merely showing the chippings, here and there, in
patches.&nbsp; The whole work presents a most even and beautiful
road, and, yesterday, during the day, attracted the notice of
many hundreds of persons.&nbsp; The portion, however, it is but
justice to add, to which attention was more particularly
directed, was that of the wooden blocks, the noiseless tendency
of which, made the vehicles passing along, appear to be rolling
over a thick carpet or rug.&nbsp; The time allowed by the Vestry
of St. Marylebone for the test of these experiments, is until the
last Saturday of June next, when the official report of the
surveyors will be laid before that body, and upon which the fate
of Oxford Street depends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>People began to feel that it was high time that the Queen
should marry&mdash;but, as yet, no signs of such a thing, and no
speculations, as far as I can see, were hazarded as to who her
future consort should be.&nbsp; At length, one newspaper, the
<i>Sun</i>, seems to have been inspired, by authority, and is
thus quoted in the <i>Times</i> of 24
Jan.:&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Marriage of Her
Majesty</span>.&mdash;The country will learn with delight that
the most <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>interesting part of the speech from
the throne <a name="citation81a"></a><a href="#footnote81a"
class="citation">[81a]</a> to both Houses of Parliament, and the
country at large, will be the announcement of Her Majesty&rsquo;s
intended marriage.&nbsp; The happy object of Queen
Victoria&rsquo;s choice is Prince Albert, son of the reigning
Duke of Saxe Coburg, and cousin of Her Majesty.&nbsp; Prince
Albert is handsome, and about 22 years of age.&nbsp; He has
resided, for some time, in this country, on a visit to his Royal
relatives.&nbsp; How soon the happy event is to take place, we
are not prepared to say, but our readers may depend upon the
authenticity of our information.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>The
Sun</i>.&nbsp; Has not some wag been hoaxing the editor?&nbsp; We
suspect so, though, at the same time, we do not profess to have
any knowledge on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Indeed, it was about time that the Queen married, and got out
of the leading strings of the women folk who surrounded
her.&nbsp; Had she been married, we should, probably, have never
heard of the sad episode of Lady Flora Hastings.</p>
<p>This lady, who was highly accomplished, and the authoress of
some pretty poems, <a name="citation81b"></a><a
href="#footnote81b" class="citation">[81b]</a> which were
published after her death, was the eldest daughter of Francis,
Marquis of Hastings, and Flora, Countess of Loudon, and was lady
of the bedchamber to the Duchess of Kent.&nbsp; Two old
busybodies, the Ladies Portman and Tavistock, spread the vile and
unfounded rumour that the unfortunate lady was <i>enceinte</i>,
and the Queen forbade Lady Flora to appear at Court until she had
submitted to the indignity of a medical examination.&nbsp; The
case called forth some very strong feeling&mdash;and a vast
quantity of correspondence was published on the subject,
especially the indignant letters of the poor lady&rsquo;s mother
to the Queen; but, perhaps, the most temperate account of the
whole affair, is in a letter from Lady Flora&rsquo;s uncle, Mr.
Hamilton Fitzgerald, which <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>was published
in the <i>Examiner</i> of Sunday, 24th of March, and, afterwards,
copied into all the daily papers.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Many
false and contradictory reports of the deplorable insult which
has been lately offered to my niece, Lady Flora Hastings, at
Buckingham Palace, having appeared in the public papers, I, as
her ladyship&rsquo;s nearest connection, feel it my duty to
request of you to publish the following account of the
transaction, for the correctness of which I vouch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Flora arrived, some weeks since, from Scotland,
very unwell.&nbsp; She immediately consulted Sir James Clark, the
physician to both Her Majesty and the Duchess of Kent.&nbsp; One
symptom of her complaint was a swelling of the stomach.&nbsp; By
dint of exercise and medical treatment, she was getting better;
the swelling had considerably subsided, and she had every hope of
a speedy recovery; when, on or about the 1st of March, Sir James
Clark went to her room, and announced to her the conviction of
the ladies of the Palace that she was pregnant.&nbsp; In answer
to all his exhortations to confession, &lsquo;as the only means
of saving her character,&rsquo; Lady Flora returned an indignant,
but steady denial that there was anything to confess.&nbsp; Upon
which, Sir James Clark told her, &lsquo;that nothing but her
submitting to a medical examination would ever satisfy them, or
remove the stigma from her name.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lady Flora found
that the subject had been brought before the Queen&rsquo;s
notice, and that all this had been discussed, arranged and
denounced to her, without one word having been said on the
subject to her own mistress, the Duchess of Kent; who had no
suspicion of what was going on, and whose sanction was not sought
for the humiliating proposition which had been made to Lady
Flora.&nbsp; On leaving Lady Flora&rsquo;s room, Sir James Clark
went to the Duchess of Kent, and announced his conviction that
Lady Flora was with child; and was followed by Lady Portman, who
conveyed a message from Her Majesty to her mother, that the Queen
would not permit Lady Flora to appear till the examination had
taken place.&nbsp; Lady Portman (who, with Lady Tavistock, are
mentioned <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>as most active against Lady Flora)
expressed to the Duchess of Kent, her conviction of Lady
Flora&rsquo;s guilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Her beloved mistress&rsquo; never, for a moment,
doubted Lady Flora&rsquo;s innocence.&nbsp; She said that she
knew her, her principles, and her family too well to listen to
such a charge.&nbsp; However, the edict was given; and, the next
day, Lady Flora having obtained the Duchess of Kent&rsquo;s very
reluctant consent&mdash;&lsquo;for Her Royal Highness could not
bear the idea of her being exposed to such a
humiliation&rsquo;&mdash;but, Lady Flora, &lsquo;feeling it her
duty to Her Royal Highness, to herself, and to her family, that a
point blank refutation should be instantly given to the
lie,&rsquo; submitted herself to the most rigid examination; and
now possesses a certificate, signed by Sir James Clark, and also
by Sir Charles Clark, stating, as strongly as language can state
it, that there are no grounds for believing that pregnancy does
exist, or ever has existed.&nbsp; Lord Hastings, though, at the
time very ill from influenza, went to London immediately, and
demanded, and obtained, from Lord Melbourne, a distinct disavowal
of his participation in the affair; and demanded, and obtained,
an audience of Her Majesty, in which, while he disclaimed all
idea that the Queen had any wish to injure his sister, he
plainly, though respectfully, stated his opinion of those who had
counselled her, and his resolution to find out the originator of
the slander, and bring him, or her, to punishment.&nbsp; Lady
Flora is convinced that the Queen was surprised into the order
which was given, and that Her Majesty did not understand what she
was betrayed into; for, ever since the horrid event, Her Majesty
has shown her regret by the most gracious kindness to Lady Flora,
and expressed it warmly, with &lsquo;tears in her
eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Duchess of Kent&rsquo;s conduct was perfect;
&lsquo;a mother could not have been kinder.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;She immediately dismissed Sir James Clark from her
service, and refused to see Lady Portman&rsquo;; and has crowned
her goodness by a most beautiful letter she has written to the
Dowager Lady Hastings, from whom the accounts were kept, till all
hope of avoiding publicity was impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>Her brother, the Marquis of Hastings, was indefatigable
in trying to unearth the promoters of the scandal, but, from the
published letters, without much result; but the unfortunate
affair involved the whole Court, for a time, in
unpopularity&mdash;Lady Loudon, her mother, demanded from the
Queen, Sir James Clark&rsquo;s dismissal, but was not
successful.&nbsp; Meantime, the object of all this agitation,
after resuming, for a time, the duties of her situation, grew
gradually worse, and, at length, expired, on the 5th July, at the
age of 33.&nbsp; By the desire of Lord Hastings, a <i>post
mortem</i> examination of the body took place, the particulars of
which, attested by five of the most eminent surgeons of the
metropolis, were published in the papers, and fully established
the unfortunate lady&rsquo;s complete innocence of the charge
brought against her, the cause of death being clearly shown to be
enlargement of the liver.</p>
<p>Lady Flora&rsquo;s remains were removed from the palace, at an
early hour in the morning, to be conveyed, by steamboat, to
Scotland.&nbsp; Even as early as two o&rsquo;clock, a
considerable number of spectators were assembled, which increased
in every street through which the procession passed.&nbsp; Four
Royal carriages, including those of the Queen and the Queen
Dowager, and many belonging to the nobility, accompanied the
hearse.&nbsp; Lady Flora&rsquo;s body was interred, on the 15th
of July, in the family vault at Loudon, Ayrshire.</p>
<p>There were many books and pamphlets published with regard to
this affair, among which were her mother&rsquo;s letters to the
Queen: &ldquo;The Lady Flora Hastings, a Brief
Sketch&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A Warning to the Baroness Lehzen, <a
name="citation84"></a><a href="#footnote84"
class="citation">[84]</a> etc.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The Palace

Hastings&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The late Lady Flora Hastings:

<p>At the time of which I write, climbing boys were still
employed to sweep chimneys, and as a sample of the manner <!--
page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>in which they were treated by their masters, I give the
following police case.&nbsp; 25 Jan.:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Marlborough
Street</span>.&mdash;Henry Riddle, foreman to Robert Towser, a
chimney sweep, appeared before the magistrates on a summons
charging him under the 4 &amp; 5 Wil. IV., c. 35, with the
following act of cruelty towards James Arnold, a boy about 12
years of age, and who, for some time past, had been in
Towser&rsquo;s employ.</p>
<p>Mr. Rice, a baker, of 31, Up. Seymour St., Portman Sq.,
deposed that, on the afternoon of the 18th instant, his kitchen
chimney, by some accident, caught fire; and, in consequence of
information thereof being communicated to the defendant Riddle,
he, soon afterwards, came to the house, bringing with him the boy
Arnold, whom he, at once, desired to ascend, notwithstanding that
the lighted soot was, at the time, coming down into the grate in
large flakes.</p>
<p>Mr. Rawlinson: Did you remonstrate with Riddle upon the
inhumanity of his conduct?</p>
<p>Complainant: I did, and begged of him not to send the boy up,
as he would, inevitably, be suffocated; to which he replied,
&ldquo;Oh, d---n it, I&rsquo;ve many a time been up a chimney ten
times worse than that, myself, and why can&rsquo;t he do
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; At this period, I had occasion to go upstairs,
and made my way on to the roof, just as a friend of mine was
about to pour down a quantity of water, when I begged of him not
to do so, as I fancied I heard the voice of someone within a
short distance of the top of the chimney; we both listened, and
heard someone faintly say, &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, take the
chimney pot off, or I shall be suffocated.&rdquo;&nbsp; With some
difficulty we tore away the mortar, and, having removed the pot,
we beheld the poor boy Arnold, who kept crying out, &ldquo;Oh!
pull me up, pull me up!&rdquo;&nbsp; My friend then thrust down
his arm, and, laying hold of the little sufferer, succeeded in
extricating him from his perilous situation.</p>
<p>Mr. Rawlinson: Was the chimney, at the time, still on
fire?</p>
<p>Complainant: It was, Sir.</p>
<p><!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>Mr. Rawlinson: In what condition did the boy seem when
lifted out of the chimney?</p>
<p>Complainant: He seemed almost in a lifeless state, and when
carrying him in my arms downstairs, I was fearful he would not
recover.&nbsp; After the lapse of a little time, I gave him a
small quantity of brandy, and he, in a great measure, revived;
Riddle then took hold of him, and leading him to the roof of the
house, insisted upon his descending from the top to the bottom of
the chimney, which he did, and he and Riddle then left the
place.</p>
<p>Mr. Rawlinson (to Riddle): What answer have you to make for
ill-treating this poor boy in so shameful a manner?</p>
<p>Riddle: The boy is not an apprentice, and he was not sent up
the chimney until a quantity of water had been thrown down.</p>
<p>Mr. Rawlinson, after remarking upon the atrocious nature of
the offence, ordered Riddle to find bail to answer the charge at
the Sessions; at the same time expressing a hope that a severe
example would be made of him.</p>

<p>From 1838 to 1841, there was exhibiting in London a famous
lion tamer named Van Amburgh, and, in January, 1839, the Queen
went to Drury Lane Theatre to witness his performance, with which
she was so pleased, that she commissioned Sir Edwin Landseer to
paint a picture of Van Amburgh and his lions, which was exhibited
in 1839, and is now in the Royal Collection at Osborne.&nbsp; If
I am not very much mistaken there is another, by the same artist,
of the same subject, in the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s town
mansion, at Apsley House.</p>
<p>We can see how long it takes to carry out well-known and
wanted improvements&mdash;take the Thames Embankment for
example.&nbsp; Originally suggested by Wren after the great fire
of London in 1666, and afterwards by William Paterson, the
founder of the Bank of England, about 1694, the matter slumbered
until 1767, when the Corporation of the City of London embanked
one mile of the river.&nbsp; The question arose spasmodically
until 1838, when the Corporation consulted with <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>the
Government as to the advisability of embanking the Thames all the
way between London and Vauxhall Bridges, and, in Jan., 1839, the
Government sanctioned surveys being made and estimates prepared;
the whole correspondence concerning which may be found in the
<i>Times</i> of 2 Feb., 1839.&nbsp; But no practical steps were
taken in the matter until 1860, when the Metropolitan Board of
Works memorialised the House of Commons, and a Committee was
appointed which sat for the first time on 30 Ap., 1861.&nbsp; An
Act for carrying out the scheme was passed on 7 Aug., 1862, and
the work was commenced in Nov. of the same year.&nbsp; The
northern (Victoria) embankment, which terminated at Whitehall
Stairs, was opened (as far as the footway went) to the public on
30 July, 1868.</p>
<p>Victoria Park took a shorter time to mature.&nbsp; The first
mention of it, that I can find, is in the <i>Times</i> of March,
1839: &ldquo;The inhabitants of St. Mary, Whitechapel, are
bestirring themselves to obtain the formation of a Royal Park in
their neighbourhood, and the Vestry of the parish are about to
bring the matter before the public.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they did so
with such good effect that an Act was passed on 21 June, 1841 (4
&amp; 5 Vic., c. 27), &ldquo;To enable Her Majesty&rsquo;s
Commissioners of Works to complete the Contract for the Sale of
York House, and to purchase certain lands for a Royal
Park.&rdquo;&nbsp; York House was sold to the Duke of Sutherland,
and with the whole, or part, of the purchase money, the
Commissioners were to purchase certain lands or hereditaments
containing about 290 acres, which &ldquo;shall for ever,
thereafter, be taken and be a Royal Park, by the name of
&lsquo;Victoria Park.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The Park was completed,
and opened to the public, in 1845.</p>
<p>On Monday, 25 March, occurred a most daring robbery of gold
dust valued at &pound;4,600, which, at the time, created a great
sensation.&nbsp; It seems that two boxes of gold dust were
brought to this country from Mexico, in the Sea Gull Packet,
consigned to the Brazilian Mining Co., and were landed at
Falmouth.&nbsp; They were, subsequently, transshipped on board
the City of Limerick steamer, which arrived at Dublin on Sunday
afternoon.&nbsp; The boxes were not landed at the wharf <!-- page
88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>until
Monday morning, and, at noon on that day, the stranger who
obtained possession of them drove up to the wharf in a cab which
he had hired in the city.&nbsp; The letter which he presented to
the wharfinger for the delivery of the boxes was in the same
handwriting as one which the wharfinger had received from
Falmouth, and which bore the postmark of that place, in the
morning.&nbsp; It gave particular directions respecting the
boxes, and that they were only to be delivered to a gentleman who
would call in the course of the day, and present a letter in the
same handwriting for their delivery.&nbsp; The person who
obtained the boxes accurately described their contents, the marks
on them, and the time they were landed at Falmouth.&nbsp; The
wharfinger, as might be expected, was completely put off his
guard by the ingenuity and cunning of the thief, and delivered
them over to him.</p>
<p>On 3 April, two Jews, Ellis and Lewis Caspar, father and son,
were brought up at Lambeth Street Police Station for being
concerned in the robbery; afterwards, two other prisoners,
Emanuel Moses and his daughter, Alice Abrahams, were arrested,
and all were committed for trial, the Caspars for stealing the
gold, the other two for feloniously receiving the same, well
knowing it to be stolen.&nbsp; They were tried at the Central
Criminal Court on 24 June, the trial lasting eight days.&nbsp;
The jury found them all guilty, but recommended Alice Abrahams to
mercy, believing that she acted under the advice and influence of
her father.&nbsp; Judgment was not pronounced on them until 3
Feb., 1840, when the three male prisoners were sentenced to
fourteen years&rsquo; transportation, and the female to four
months&rsquo; hard labour.&nbsp; The Jewish community tried all
their influence to get these sentences modified, but the convicts
sailed for Sydney in the following October.&nbsp; The expenses of
the prosecutor in connection with the trial amounted to
&pound;2,900!</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s Statue&mdash;The
Ladies of the Bedchamber&mdash;The Queen hissed at Ascot
Races&mdash;Land at Melbourne&mdash;Sunday Trading&mdash;New way
of paying Church Rates.</p>
<p><i>Times</i>, 25 Ap.&mdash;&ldquo;The workmen engaged some
time since in taking down an old public house adjoining St.
Dunstan&rsquo;s Church, in Fleet St., discovered in one of the
cellars the ancient stone statue of Queen Elizabeth, which
formerly stood in the nave of the old church.&nbsp; The parochial
authorities have resolved to place it on the east end of the
church, fronting Fleet Street.&rdquo;&nbsp; An unfortunate
position, for many raw, unlettered Irishmen, or women, have
mistaken it, owing to its environment, to be a statue of the
Virgin Mary, and have devoutly crossed themselves, and said their
&ldquo;Aves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About this time occurred a political complication which
afforded great scope for gossip, and which showed that it was
about time that the Queen was freed from her female
<i>entourage</i>, and had the protective advice of a
husband.&nbsp; On the 7th May, Lord Melbourne, having been
beaten, by a small majority, on the Bill concerning the
Suspension of the Constitution in Jamaica, resigned, and Sir
Robert Peel was commissioned by the Queen to form a new
Ministry.&nbsp; He did so, but, for valid reasons, he required
the resignation, as was, and is, usual, of the ladies of the
household.&nbsp; In order that there shall be no bias on this
divergence of opinion between the Sovereign and her Minister, I
quote a portion of Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s speech in the House of
Commons, on 13 May, taking it from the authorised version of
<i>Hansard</i>.&nbsp; Sir Robert said that there was but one
subject of disunion between himself and Her Majesty.</p>
<p><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>&ldquo;The difficulty arose with respect to certain
portions of that part of the establishment which is filled by the
Ladies of the household.&nbsp; Sir, I think it infinitely better,
on this point&mdash;the one on which the difficulty arose&mdash;I
think it infinitely better, after mature consideration&mdash;that
I should not enter&mdash;in the first instance, at least, nor
unless invited by the noble Lord (John Russell)&mdash;into any
statement whatever of impressions on my own mind with respect to
what took place&mdash;but that I should refer exclusively to the
letters which passed on the subject; because if I were to state,
here, impressions of my own, I must detail verbal communications
that passed, where two parties only were present; and myself one
of the party, being alone in this House to offer explanations of
what occurred.&nbsp; I approach, then, that point with respect to
which the difficulty, on this occasion, arose; and, for the
purpose of enabling the House to form a judgment with respect to
the nature of that difficulty, I shall confine myself,
altogether, to the written documents which passed on the
occasion, in which are conveyed the impressions on the mind of
Her Majesty, and the impressions on my own mind, with regard to
the purport and effect of the communications which passed between
Her Majesty and myself, in respect to certain appointments in the
household, which are held by Ladies.&nbsp; Now, whatever blame
may attach on account of imperfect explanations, I am content to
bear it; whatever consequences may result from misconception, let
them be visited on me; but, as to my intentions in regard to the
Ladies of the household, I must not only state them, but I must
prove them by most unequivocable testimony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the Wednesday evening&mdash;that is, the day before
I saw Her Majesty on this particular point&mdash;I had an
opportunity of conferring with all those whom I proposed to
submit to Her Majesty as Ministers.&nbsp; I saw them on Wednesday
night, at my own house, about ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I then
stated to them&mdash;and there are four of them now present, who
heard the communication, and can give their evidence upon
it&mdash;I stated to them, and to the peers whom I have before
named, the course which I meant to pursue with respect to the
household, <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>and had very little considered the
matter (I am speaking of the female part of it); I, really,
scarcely knew of whom it consisted.&nbsp; I took the &lsquo;Red
Book&rsquo; into my hand, and saw there the different
appointments of the household.&nbsp; I said to those who were
intended to be my future colleagues, that, with respect to all
the subordinate appointments&mdash;meaning every appointment,
without exception, below the rank of a Lady of the
Bedchamber&mdash;I should propose to Her Majesty no change
whatever with respect to those.&nbsp; With respect to the
superior classes, I stated, that those Ladies who held offices of
that class, and who were immediate relatives of <i>our</i>
political opponents, would, I took it for granted, relieve us
from any difficulty by, at once, relinquishing their
offices.&nbsp; But, I stated, at the same time, that I did think
it of great importance, as conveying an indication of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s entire support and confidence, that certain
offices in the household, of the higher rank, if not voluntarily
relinquished by the Ladies holding them, should be submitted to
some change Even with respect to the higher offices, namely, the
Ladies of the Bedchamber, I did state, however, that there were
some instances, in which, from the absence of any strong party,
or political, connection, I thought it would be wholly
unnecessary to propose a change.&nbsp; My noble and Right Hon.
friends will confirm what I assert.&nbsp; This passed on the
evening of Wednesday; and I mention it only in complete proof of
my intentions, being perfectly willing, as I have before
observed, to have transferred, exclusively to me, whatever blame
may be attached to the imperfect explanation of my views.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Her Majesty on Thursday, and verbal
communications took place on this subject.&nbsp; As I stated
before, into the nature of those communications I shall not now
enter in the slightest degree.&nbsp; I shall merely read the two
letters which passed; one conveying the impressions of Her
Majesty, and the other my own.&nbsp; The letter which I had the
honour of receiving from Her Majesty is dated May the 10th,
1839.&nbsp; I received it at an early hour on Friday morning, and
it is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><!-- page 92--><a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Buckingham Palace.&mdash;May 10, 1839.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Queen, having considered the proposal made
to her, yesterday, by Sir Robert Peel, to remove the Ladies of
her Bedchamber, cannot consent to adopt a course which she
conceives to be contrary to usage, and which is repugnant to her
feelings.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately&mdash;that is, in two or three hours after
having received the letter from Her Majesty, I addressed to Her
Majesty a letter, of which this is a copy:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align:
right">&ldquo;&lsquo;Whitehall.&mdash;May 10, 1839.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and has had the honour of receiving your Majesty&rsquo;s
note of this morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In respectfully submitting to your
Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure, and humbly returning into your
Majesty&rsquo;s hands the important trust which your Majesty had
graciously pleased to commit to him, Sir Robert Peel trusts that
your Majesty will permit him to state to your Majesty his
impression with respect to the circumstances which have led to
the termination of his attempt to form an Administration for the
conduct of your Majesty&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the interview with which your Majesty
honoured Sir Robert Peel, yesterday morning, after he had
submitted to your Majesty the names of those whom he proposed to
recommend to your Majesty for the principal executive
appointments, he mentioned to your Majesty his earnest wish, to
be enabled, with your Majesty&rsquo;s sanction, so to constitute
your Majesty&rsquo;s household, that your Majesty&rsquo;s
confidential servants might have the advantage of a public
demonstration of your Majesty&rsquo;s full support and
confidence; and that, at the same time, as far as possible,
consistently with that demonstration, each individual appointment
in the household should be entirely acceptable to your
Majesty&rsquo;s personal feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;On your Majesty&rsquo;s expressing a desire that
the Earl of Liverpool should hold an office in the household, Sir
Robert Peel requested your Majesty&rsquo;s permission at once to
offer <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>to Lord Liverpool the office of Lord
Steward, or any other which he might prefer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir Robert Peel then observed, that he should
have every wish to apply a similar principle to the chief
appointments which are filled by the Ladies of your
Majesty&rsquo;s household; upon which your Majesty was pleased to
remark, that you must reserve the whole of those appointments,
and that it was your Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure, that the whole
should continue as at present, without any change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Duke of Wellington, in the interview to which your
Majesty subsequently admitted him, understood, also, that this
was your Majesty&rsquo;s determination, and concurred with Sir
Robert Peel in opinion that, considering the great difficulties
of the present crisis, and the expediency of making every effort,
in the first instance, to conduct the public business of the
country with the aid of the present Parliament, it was essential
to the success of the commission with which your Majesty had
honoured Sir Robert Peel, that he should have that public proof
of your Majesty&rsquo;s entire support and confidence, which
would be afforded by the permission to make some changes in that
part of your Majesty&rsquo;s household, which your Majesty
resolved on maintaining entirely without change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having had the opportunity, through your
Majesty&rsquo;s gracious consideration, of reflecting upon this
point, he humbly submits to your Majesty that he is reluctantly
compelled, by a sense of public duty, and in interest of your
Majesty&rsquo;s service, to adhere to the opinion which he
ventured to express to your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a later portion of his speech, Sir Robert remarks:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I, upon that very question of Ireland,
should have begun in a minority of upwards of twenty
members.&nbsp; A majority of twenty-two had decided in favour of
the policy of the Irish Government.&nbsp; The chief members of
the Irish Government, whose policy was so approved of, were the
Marquis <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span

By whom are the two chief offices in the household at this moment
held?&nbsp; By the sister of Lord Morpeth, and the wife of Lord
Normanby.&nbsp; Let me not, for a moment, be supposed to say a
word not fraught with respect towards those two ladies, who cast
a lustre on the society in which they move, less by their rank
than their accomplishments and virtues; but still, they stand in
the situation of the nearest relatives of the two Members of the
Government, whose policy was approved by this House, and
disapproved by me.&nbsp; Now, I ask any man in the House, whether
it is possible that I could, with propriety and honour, undertake
the conduct of an Administration, and the management of Irish
affairs in this House, consenting previously, as an express
preliminary stipulation, that the two ladies 1 have named,
together with all others, should be retained in their
appointments about the court and person of the Sovereign?&nbsp;
Sir, the policy of these things depends not upon
precedent&mdash;not upon what has been done in former times; it
mainly depends upon a consideration of the present.&nbsp; The
household has been allowed to assume a completely political
character, and that on account of the nature of the appointments
which have been made by Her Majesty&rsquo;s present Government I
do not complain of it&mdash;it may have been a wise policy to
place in the chief offices of the household, ladies closely
connected with the Members of the Administration; but, remember
that this policy does seriously to the public embarrassment of
their successors, if ladies, being the nearest relatives of the
retired Ministers, are to continue in their offices about the
person of the Sovereign.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Lord Melbourne, returned to power.</p>

<p>The genial Caricaturist John Doyle, as there were no
illustrated comic papers in those days, illustrated this incident
in his H. B. Sketches.&nbsp; No. 591 is &ldquo;A Scene from the
farce of <i>The Invincibles</i>, as lately performed in the
Queen&rsquo;s Theatre&rdquo;&mdash;in which the Duke of
Wellington and Sir Robert Peel are being expelled at the point of
the bayonet, by ladies clad as soldiers.&nbsp; Sir Robert says:
&ldquo;These Household Troops charge <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>in a most
disorderly manner, but they are too many for us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
While the Duke observes: &ldquo;Our position is no longer
tenable; draw off in good order, while I cover the
retreat.&rdquo;&nbsp; No. 592 is &ldquo;The Balance of
Power.&nbsp; The figure proposed to displace the old one of
Justice at the top of Constitution Hill.&rdquo;&nbsp; It shows a
statue of the Queen, as Justice, holding a pair of scales, in
which &ldquo;Private Friendship,&rdquo; typified by two ladies of
the household, weighs down &ldquo;Public Service&rdquo; full of
Ministers.&nbsp; I have here reproduced No. 597,
&ldquo;Child&rsquo;s Play,&rdquo; in which figure the Queen, the
Duchess of Sutherland, the Marchioness of Normanby, and other
ladies of the household.&nbsp; No. 599 is a &ldquo;Curious
instance of (Ministerial) &lsquo;Resuscitation,&rsquo; effected
by distinguished members of the <i>Royal</i> Humane
Society.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord Melbourne is lying on a couch,
attended by the Queen and ladies of the household.&nbsp; The
Queen holds a smelling bottle to his nose, and says: &ldquo;Ah,
there&rsquo;s a dear, now do revive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether it was owing to this affair, or not, I know not, but
at Ascot races this year the Queen was absolutely hissed at by
some one, or more persons&mdash;and the <i>Times</i> of 25 June
quotes from the <i>Morning Post</i> thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At the last Ascot races, we have reason to
believe that the Duchess of Montrose and Lady Sarah Ingestre
received an intimation that Her Majesty was impressed with the
idea that they were among the persons who had hissed at a moment
when no sounds but those of applause, gratulation and loyalty
ought to have been heard.&nbsp; It was, we believe, further
intimated to the noble ladies we have mentioned, that the Royal
ear had been abused, to the effect already stated, by Lady
Lichfield.&nbsp; The ladies, who had reason to think that they
had been thus unjustly and ridiculously accused, applied
immediately to their supposed accuser, who denied that she had
made any such communication.&nbsp; On being urged to give this
denial in writing, she declined to do so without first consulting
her lord.&nbsp; But, on the application being renewed at a
subsequent period, her ladyship, as we understand, explicitly,
and in writing, denied that she had given utterance <!-- page
97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>to
the calumny in question.&nbsp; Here the matter stood, until, from
some incidents connected with the late ball at Buckingham Palace,
the two ladies, thus impeached, saw reason to believe that the
erroneous impression communicated to Her Majesty at Ascot had not
been entirely removed.&nbsp; It was an impression, however, which
they could not permit to remain without employing every means of
removing it; and, accordingly, the Duchess of Montrose went to
Buckingham Palace, and requested an audience of Her
Majesty.&nbsp; After waiting for a considerable period (two
hours, as we have been informed), her Grace was informed by the
Earl of Uxbridge, that she could not be admitted to an audience,
as none but Peers and Peeresses in their own right could demand
that privilege.&nbsp; Her Grace then insisted upon Lord Uxbridge
taking down in writing what she had to say, and promising her
that the communication should immediately be laid before Her
Majesty.&nbsp; In this state, we believe, the matter remains,
substantially, at the present moment, although it has taken a new
form, the Duke of Montrose having, we understand, thought it
necessary to open a correspondence upon the subject with Lord
Melbourne.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was only a partial denial given to the above, which
appeared in the <i>Times</i> of 5 July.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are
authorised to give the most positive denial to a report which has
been inserted in most of the public papers, that the Countess of
Lichfield informed the Queen that the Duchess of Montrose and
Lady Sarah Ingestre hissed Her Majesty on the racecourse at
Ascot.&nbsp; Lady Lichfield never insinuated, or countenanced any
such report, and there could have been no foundation for so
unjust an accusation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Melbourne, in Australia (named, of course, after the Premier),
was founded 1 June, 1837, and I mention the fact to shew the
prosperity of the infant city&mdash;for in two years&rsquo; time,
on this its second anniversary, certain lots of land had advanced
in price from &pound;7 to &pound;600, and from &pound;27 to
&pound;930.</p>
<p>I cannot help chronicling an amusing story anent Sunday
trading.&nbsp; For some time the parish authorities of Islington
<!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>had been rigidly prosecuting shopkeepers for keeping
open their shops on Sunday, for the sale of their goods, such not
being &ldquo;a work of necessity, or mercy,&rdquo; and numerous
convictions were recorded.&nbsp; Most of the persons convicted
were poor, and with large families, who sold tobacco, fruit,
cakes and sweets, in a very humble way of business, and
considerable discontent and indignation was manifested in the
parish in consequence of such prosecutions; the outcry was raised
that there was one law for the rich and another for the poor, and
a party that strongly opposed the proceedings on the part of the
parish, resolved to try the legality and justice of the question,
by instituting proceedings against the vicar&rsquo;s coachman,
for &ldquo;exercising his worldly calling on the Sabbath
day,&rdquo; by driving his reverend master to church, that not
being a work of necessity, or mercy, as the reverend gentleman
was able both to walk and preach on the same day.&nbsp; For this
purpose a party proceeded to the neighbourhood of the
vicar&rsquo;s stables one Sunday, and watched the proceedings of
the coachman, whom they saw harness his horses, put them to the
carriage, go to the vicar&rsquo;s house, take him up, and drive
him to church, where he entered the pulpit, and preached his
sermon.&nbsp; One day, the following week, they attended Hatton
Garden Police Office and applied to Mr. Benett for a summons
against the coachman.&nbsp; The magistrate, on hearing the nature
of the application, told them it was a doubtful case, and the
clerk suggested that if they laid their information the
magistrate might receive it, and decide on the legal merits of
the case.&nbsp; This was done, the summons was granted, and a day
appointed for hearing the case.</p>
<p>This took place on June 14, when John Wells, coachman to the
vicar of Islington, appeared to answer the complaint of Frederick
Hill, a tobacconist, for exercising his worldly calling on the
Sabbath day.</p>
<p>John Hanbury, grocer, of 3, Pulteney Street, being sworn,
stated that, on Sunday, the 9th inst, about 1 o&rsquo;clock, he
saw the defendant, who is coachman to the vicar of Islington,
drive his coach to the Church of St. Mary, Islington, where he
<!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>took up the vicar and his lady, and drove them to their
residence in Barnsbury Park.</p>
<p>Mr. Benett: Are you sure it was the vicar?</p>
<p>Witness: I heard him preach.</p>
<p>John Jones, of Felix Terrace, Islington, corroborated this
evidence.</p>
<p>Mr. Benett said, that the Act of Parliament laid down that no
tradesman, labourer, or other person shall exercise his worldly
calling on the Lord&rsquo;s day, it not being a work of necessity
or charity.&nbsp; He would ask whether it was not a work of
necessity for the vicar to proceed to church to preach.&nbsp; A
dissenter might say it was not a work of necessity.&nbsp; The
coachman was not an artificer who was paid by the hour or the
day, but he was engaged by the year, or the quarter, and was not
to be viewed in the light of a grocer, or tradesman, who opened
his shop for the sale of his goods on the Sabbath day.&nbsp;
After explaining the law upon the subject, he said that he was of
opinion that the defendant driving the vicar to church on
Sundays, to perform his religious duties, was an act of
necessity, and did not come within the meaning of the law, and he
dismissed the case.</p>
<p>The clergy did not seem to be much in favour with their
flocks, for I read in the <i>Annual Register</i>, 1 Aug., of
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">A New Way of Paying Church
Rates</span>.&mdash;Mr. Osborne, a dissenter, of Tewkesbury,
having declined to pay Church Rates, declaring that he could not
conscientiously do so, a sergeant and two officers of the police
went to his house for the purpose of levying under a distress
warrant to the amount due from him.&nbsp; The officers were asked
to sit down, which they did, and Mr. Osborne went into his
garden, procured a hive of bees, and threw it into the middle of
the chamber.&nbsp; The officers were, of course, obliged to
retreat, but they secured enough of the property to pay the rate,
and the costs of the levy, besides which, they obtained a warrant
against Mr. Osborne, who would, most likely, pay dearly for his
new and <i>conscientious</i> method of settling Church Rate
accounts.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm">The Eglinton Tournament&mdash;Sale of Armour,
&amp;c.&mdash;The Queen of Beauty and her Cook&mdash;Newspapers
and their Sales.</p>
<p>The Earl of Eglinton had a &ldquo;bee in his bonnet,&rdquo;
which was none other than reviving the tournaments of the Age of
Chivalry, with real armour, horses and properties; and he
inoculated with his craze most of the young aristocracy, and
induced them to join him in carrying it out.&nbsp; The
preliminary rehearsals took place in the grounds of the Eyre Arms
Tavern, Kilburn.&nbsp; The last of these came off on 13 July, in
the presence of some 6,000 spectators, mostly composed of the
aristocracy.&nbsp; The following is a portion of the account
which appeared in the <i>Times</i> of 15 July:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At 4 o&rsquo;clock the business of the day
commenced.&nbsp; There might be seen men in complete steel,
riding with light lances at the ring, attacking the
&lsquo;quintain,&rsquo; and man&oelig;uvering their steeds in
every variety of capricole.&nbsp; Indeed, the show of horses was
one of the best parts of the sight.&nbsp; Trumpeters were calling
the jousters to horse, and the wooden figure, encased in iron
panoply, was prepared for the attack.&nbsp; A succession of
chevaliers, <i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>, rode at their
hardy and unflinching antagonist, who was propelled to the combat
by the strength of several stout serving-men, in the costume of
the olden time, and made his helmet and breastplate rattle
beneath their strokes, but the wooden</p>
<p>. . . Knight<br />
Was mickle of might,<br />
And stiff in Stower did stand,</p>
<p><!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>grinning defiance through the barred aventaile of his
headpiece.&nbsp; It was a sight that might have roused the spirit
of old Froissart, or the ghost of Hotspur.&nbsp; The Knight had,
certainly, no easy task to perform; the weight of armour was
rather heavier than the usual trappings of a modern dandy, and
the heat of the sun appeared to be baking the bones of some of
the competitors.&nbsp; Be this as it may, there was no
flinching.&nbsp; The last part of the tournament consisted of the
Knights tilting at each other.&nbsp; The Earl of Eglinton, in a
splendid suit of brass armour, with <i>garde de reins</i> of
plated chain mail, and bearing on his casque a plume of ostrich
feathers, was assailed by Lord Cranstoun, in a suit of polished
steel, which covered him from top to toe, the steel shoes, or
sollarets, being of the immense square-toed fashion of the time
of Henry VIII.&nbsp; The lances of these two champions were
repeatedly shivered in the attack, but neither was unhorsed;
fresh lances were supplied by the esquires, and the sport grew
&lsquo;fast and furious.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lord Glenlyon and another
knight, whose armour prevented him from being recognized, next
tilted at each other, but their horses were not sufficiently
trained to render the combat as it ought to have been, and
swerved continually from the barrier.&nbsp; It was nearly eight
o&rsquo;clock before the whole of the sports were concluded and
the company withdrawn.&nbsp; We believe no accident happened,
though several gentlemen who essayed to &lsquo;witch the world
with noble horsemanship&rsquo; were thrown, amidst the laughter
of the spectators.&nbsp; Captain Maynard proved himself a
superior rider, by the splendid style at which he leaped his
horse, at speed, repeatedly over the barrier, and the admirable
manner in which he performed the modern lance exercise, and made
a very beautiful charger curvet round and round his lance placed
upright on the ground.&nbsp; The whole of the arrangements were
under the direction of Mr. Pratt, to whose discretion the
ordering of the tilting, the armour and arming, and all the
appliances for the tournament have been entrusted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considering that the business of Saturday was but a
rehearsal, and, putting entirely out of the question the folly,
or wisdom, of the whole thing, it must be acknowledged that <!--
page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>it has been well got up.&nbsp; Some of the
heralds&rsquo; and pursuivants&rsquo; costumes are very
splendid.&nbsp; There is an immense store of armour of all sorts,
pennons, lances, trappings, and all the details of the wars of
the middle ages.&nbsp; The display in Scotland will, certainly,
be a gorgeous pageant, and a most extraordinary, if not most
rational, piece of pastime.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The three days&rsquo; jousting and hospitality at Eglinton
Castle, Ayrshire, which commenced on the 28th, and ended on the
30th, August, are said to have cost the Earl of Eglinton the sum
of &pound;40,000.&nbsp; He invited the flower of the aristocracy
to attend&mdash;all the armour was choice and old, and the
costumes were splendid.&nbsp; Every accessory was perfect in its
way; and so it should have been, for it was two years in
preparation.&nbsp; The Marquis of Londonderry was King of the
Tourney, and Lady Seymour, a grand-daughter of <i>the</i>
Sheridan, was the &ldquo;Queen of Love and Beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the evening of the 27th, Eglinton Castle was not only
filled from cellar to garret, but the surrounding towns and
villages were crammed full, and people had to rough it.&nbsp;
Accommodation for man, or beast, rose from 500 to 1,000 per
cent.; houses in the neighbourhood, according to their
dimensions, were let from &pound;10 to &pound;30 for the time;
and single beds, in the second best apartments of a
weaver&rsquo;s cabin, fetched from 10/- to 20/- a night, while
the master and mistress of the household, with their little ones,
coiled themselves up in any out of the way corner, as best they
might.&nbsp; Stables, byres, and sheds were in requisition for
the horses, and, with every available atom of space of this
description, it was found all too little, as people flocked from
all parts of the country.</p>
<p>The invitation given by the Earl was universal.&nbsp; Those
who applied for tickets of admission to the stands were requested
to appear in ancient costume, fancy dresses, or uniforms, and
farmers and others were asked to appear in bonnets and kilts, and
many&mdash;very many&mdash;did so; but although all the bonnet
makers in Kilmarnock, and all the plaid manufacturers in
Scotland, had been employed from the time of the announcement,
onwards, they could not provide <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>for the
wants of the immense crowd, and many had to go in their ordinary
dress.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, on the opening day, the weather utterly spoilt
the show.&nbsp; Before one o&rsquo;clock, the rain commenced, and
continued, with very little intermission, until the
evening.&nbsp; This, necessarily, made it very uncomfortable for
all, especially the spectators.&nbsp; Many thousands left the
field, and the enjoyment of those who remained was, in a great
measure, destroyed.&nbsp; The Grand Stand, alone, was covered in,
and neither plaid, umbrella, nor great-coat could prevail against
a deluge so heavy and unintermitting; thousands were thoroughly
drenched to the skin; but the mass only squeezed the closer
together, and the excitement of the moment overcame all external
annoyances, although the men became sodden, and the finery of the
ladies sadly bedraggled.</p>
<p>It had been arranged that the procession should start from the
Castle at one o&rsquo;clock, but the state of the weather was so
unfavourable, that it did not issue forth till about half-past
two, and the weather compelled some modifications; for instance,
the Queen of Beauty should have shown herself &ldquo;in a rich
costume, on a horse richly caparisoned, a silk canopy borne over
her by attendants in costume,&rdquo; but both she, and her
attendant ladies, who were also to have been on horseback, did
not so appear, but were in closed carriages, whilst their
beautifully caparisoned palfreys&mdash;riderless&mdash;were led
by their pages.</p>
<p>There were 15 Knights, besides the &ldquo;Lord of the
Tournament,&rdquo; the Earl of Eglinton, and much as I should
like to give their description and following, I must refrain,
merely giving two as a sample&mdash;</p>

<p>There were, besides, Knights Visitors, Swordsmen, Bowmen, the
Seneschal of the Castle, Marshals and Deputy Marshals,
Chamberlains of the household, servitors of the Castle, a Herald
and two Pursuivants, a Judge of Peace, and a Jester&mdash;besides
a horde of small fry.</p>
<p>The first tilt was between the Knights of the Swan and the Red
Rose, but it was uninteresting, the Knights passing each other
twice, without touching, and, on the third course, the Knight of
the Swan lost his lance.</p>
<p><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>Then came the tilt of the day, when the Earl of
Eglinton met the Marquis of Waterford.&nbsp; The latter was
particularly remarked, as the splendour of his brazen armour, the
beauty of his charger, and his superior skill in the management
of the animal, as well as in the bearing of his lance, attracted
general observation.&nbsp; But, alas! victory was not to be his,
for, in the first tilt, the Earl of Eglinton shivered his lance
on his opponent&rsquo;s shield, and was duly cheered by
all.&nbsp; In the second, both Knights missed; but, in the third,
the Earl again broke his lance on his opponent&rsquo;s armour; at
which there was renewed applause from the multitude; and, amidst
the cheering and music, the noble Earl rode up to the Grand
Stand, and bowed to the Queen of Beauty.</p>
<p>There were three more tilts, and a combat of two-handed
swords, which finished the outdoor amusements of the day, and,
when the deluged guests found their way to the Banqueting Hall,
they found that, and its sister tent, the Ballroom, utterly
untenantable through the rain; so they had to improvise a meal
within the Castle, and the Ball was postponed.</p>
<p>Next day was wild with wind and rain, and nothing could be
attempted out of doors, as the armour was all wet and rusty, and
every article of dress that had been worn the preceding day
completely soaked through, and the Dining Hall and the Great
Pavilion required a thorough drying.&nbsp; The former was given
up to the cleansing of armour, etc., and, in the latter, there
were various tilting matches on foot, the combatants being
clothed in armour.&nbsp; There was also fencing, both with sticks
and broadsword, among the performers being Prince Louis
Bonaparte, afterwards Napoleon III.&nbsp; His opponent with the
singlesticks was a very young gentleman, Mr. Charteris, and the
Prince came off second best in the encounter, as he did,
afterwards, in some bouts with broadswords with Mr. Charles
Lamb.&nbsp; Luckily, in this latter contest, both fought in
complete mail, with visors down, for had it not been so, and had
the combat been for life or death, the Prince would have had no
chance with his opponent.</p>
<p>On the third day the weather was fine, and the procession <!--
page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>was a success.&nbsp; There was tilting between eight
couples of Knights, and tilting at the ring, and the tourney
wound up with the Knights being halved, and started from either
end of the lists, striking at each other with their swords in
passing.&nbsp; Only one or two cuts were given, but the Marquis
of Waterford and Lord Alford fought seriously, and in right good
earnest, until stopped by the Knight Marshal, Sir Charles
Lamb.</p>
<p>In the evening, a banquet was given to 300 guests; and,
afterwards, a ball, in which 1,000 participated.&nbsp; As the
weather, next day, was so especially stormy, the party broke up,
and the experimental revival has never again been attempted,
except a Tourney on a much smaller scale, which was held on 31
Oct., 1839, at Irvine, by a party from Eglinton Castle; but this
only lasted one day.</p>
<p>I regret that I have been unable to find any authentic
engravings of this celebrated tournament, but I reproduce a
semi-comic contemporaneous etching from the <i>Satirical
Prints</i>, <i>Brit. Mus.</i></p>
<p>The armour and arms used in this tournament were shown in
Feb., 1840, at the Gallery of Ancient Armour in Grosvenor Street,
and they were subsequently sold by Auction on July 17 and 18 of
that year.&nbsp; They fetched ridiculously low prices, as the
following example will show:</p>
<p>A suit of polished steel <i>cap &agrave; pied</i> armour,
richly engraved and gilt, being the armour prepared for the
Knight of the Lion&rsquo;s Paw, with tilting shield, lance, plume
and crest <i>en suite</i>, 32 guineas.</p>
<p>The emblazoned banner and shield of the Knight of the Burning
Tower, with the suit of polished steel, <i>cap-&agrave;-pied</i>
armour, with skirt of chain mail, 35 guineas.</p>
<p>The splendid suit of armour worn by the Knight of the Ram,
with crest and plume, 24 guineas.</p>
<p>The magnificent suit of polished steel armour, worn by the
Knight of the Swan, with the emblazoned tilting apparel, horse
armour, and caparison, tilting saddle, lances to correspond, and
a splendid modelled horse of life size, carved and painted after
nature, &pound;36.</p>

<p><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Napoleon, with an elaborate visored headpiece, and other
appurtenances complete, 9 guineas.</p>
<p>The two beautifully-fashioned <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>
swords, used in the combat between Prince Louis and the Knight of
the White Rose, seven shillings.</p>
<p>On the second day&rsquo;s sale some of the suits fetched
better prices.&nbsp; The splendid suit of fluted mail, worn by
the Marquis of Waterford, was the gem of the collection.&nbsp; It
was in the finest preservation, elaborately worked, and
beautifully bright.&nbsp; It was considered one of the most
perfect and complete suits in existence, and was bought at 240
guineas for the Tower of London.&nbsp; Lord Alford&rsquo;s and
Mr. Lechmere&rsquo;s suits both went for 100 guineas each.</p>
<p>The spirit of the Tournament seems even to have affected the
ladies, for we read of a passage of arms between Lady Seymour,
the Queen of Beauty, and Lady Shuckburgh.&nbsp; It originally
appeared in the <i>Observer</i> of 8 Feb., 1840, but was copied
into the <i>Times</i> and other papers.</p>
<blockquote><p>(Copy 1).&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady Seymour presents her
compliments to Lady Shuckburgh, and would be obliged to her for
the character of Mary Stedman, who states that she has lived
twelve months, and still is, in Lady Shuckburgh&rsquo;s
establishment.&nbsp; Can Mary Stedman cook plain dishes well?
make bread? and is she honest, good tempered, sober, willing and
cleanly?&nbsp; Lady Seymour would also like to know the reason
why she leaves Lady Shuckburgh&rsquo;s service.&nbsp; Direct,
under cover, to Lord Seymour, Maiden Bradley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Copy 2.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady Shuckburgh presents her
compliments to Lady Seymour.&nbsp; Her Ladyship&rsquo;s note,
dated Oct. 28, only reached her yesterday, Nov. 3.&nbsp; Lady
Shuckburgh was unacquainted with the name of the kitchenmaid,
until mentioned by Lady Seymour, as it is her custom neither to
apply for, or give characters to any of the under servants, this
being always done by the housekeeper, Mrs. Couch, and this was
well known to the young woman; therefore Lady Shuckburgh <!--
page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>is surprised at her referring any lady to her for a
character.&nbsp; Lady Shuckburgh having a professed cook, as well
as a housekeeper, in her establishment, it is not very likely
she, herself, should know anything about the ability or merits of
the under-servants; therefore she is unable to answer Lady
Seymour&rsquo;s note.&nbsp; Lady Shuckburgh cannot imagine Mary
Stedman to be capable of cooking for any, except the
servants&rsquo; hall table.&nbsp; Nov. 4, Pavilion, Hans
Place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Copy 3.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady Seymour presents her compliments
to Lady Shuckburgh, and begs she will order her housekeeper, Mrs.
Pouch, to send the girl&rsquo;s character without delay;
otherwise, another young woman will be sought for elsewhere, as
Lady Seymour&rsquo;s children cannot remain without their
dinners, because Lady Shuckburgh, keeping &lsquo;a proffessed
cook and a housekeeper,&rsquo; thinks a knowledge of the details
of her establishment beneath her notice.&nbsp; Lady Seymour
understood from Stedman that, in addition to her other talents,
she was actually capable of dressing food for the little
Shuckburghs to partake of, when hungry.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[To this note was appended a clever pen-and-ink vignette, by
the Queen of Beauty, representing the three little Shuckburghs,
with large, turnip-looking heads and cauliflower wigs, sitting at
a round table, and voraciously scrambling for mutton chops,
dressed by Mary Stedman, who is seen looking on with supreme
satisfaction, while Lady Shuckburgh appears in the distance, in
evident dismay.]</p>
<blockquote><p>(Copy 4.)&nbsp; &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Madam</span>,&mdash;Lady Shuckburgh has directed me
to acquaint you that she declines answering your note, the
vulgarity of which is beneath contempt; and, although it may be
the characteristic of the Sheridans to be vulgar, coarse and
witty, it is not that of &lsquo;a lady,&rsquo; unless she happens
to be born in a garret and bred in a kitchen.&nbsp; Mary Stedman
informs me that your Ladyship does not keep either a cook, or a
housekeeper, and that you only require a girl who can cook a
mutton chop.&nbsp; If so, I apprehend that Mary Stedman, <!--
page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>or any other scullion, will be found fully equal to
cook for, or manage the establishment of, the Queen of
Beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, your Ladyship&rsquo;s etc.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Elizabeth Couch</span> (not Pouch.)&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even in those days, Newspapers were somewhat given to vaunt
themselves as to their circulation, but they had no need to call
in the aid of the chartered accountant, as they could get their
facts from the number of stamps supplied&mdash;the stamp then
being of the value of three halfpence per newspaper, an impost
which was not removed until 15 June, 1855, by the Act 18 and 19
Vict., c. 27.&nbsp; The <i>Times</i> of 5 Aug., 1839, gives
us</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A return of the number of Newspaper Stamps
issued to the several Newspapers in London, from 1 Ap. to 29
June, 1839, inclusive; specifying each Newspaper by name, and the
number of Stamps issued each month during that period to each
Newspaper.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm">The Chartists&mdash;Their going to
church&mdash;Dissolution of the Convention&mdash;Approaching
marriage of the Queen&mdash;The Queen and lunatics&mdash;Raid on
a Gaming House&mdash;Act of Penance.</p>
<p>This year Chartism was rampant and very militant.&nbsp; On 1
April there were riots at Devizes, on 3 May, seven men were
arrested at Manchester for drilling, and, on the 25th of that
month a great meeting was held on Kersall Moor, four miles from
Manchester.&nbsp; On 4th July there were very serious riots at
Birmingham, and again on the 15th.&nbsp; On the same date between
3,000 and 4,000 Chartists met on Clerkenwell Green to condemn the
action of the authorities at Birmingham, and, towards the end of
the month, numerous meetings were held in the North of England,
and there were riots at Newcastle and Stockport.&nbsp; In August
there was great unrest in the North, and some trials took place
at Birmingham and Manchester for rioting and sedition.</p>
<p>A new, and somewhat unexpected method of agitation, was, about
this time, adopted by the Chartists.&nbsp; They betook
themselves, suddenly, to attendance in a body at public worship,
taking early possession on the Sundays of the various cathedrals
and parish churches, to the exclusion of the more regular
attendants.&nbsp; On the afternoon of Sunday, 11 Aug., a party of
them, about 500 in number, met together in West Smithfield, and
walked in procession to St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral.&nbsp; On
arriving there, many of them refused to take off their hats; but,
after some remonstrance from the Vergers, they submitted.&nbsp;
The majority of them wore a little piece of red ribbon in their
button holes, and conducted themselves quite peaceably.&nbsp; On
the Sunday following, their brethren at Norwich <!-- page
112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>pursued a similar course at the Cathedral of that city,
which was crowded almost to suffocation.&nbsp; The Bishop, who
preached, took the opportunity to deliver an impressive
remonstrance on the folly and danger of their proceedings.&nbsp;
The Chartists behaved well in the Cathedral; but, at St.
Stephen&rsquo;s Church in the evening, they made a
disturbance.&nbsp; The Chartists at Manchester, following the
advice of Feargus O&rsquo;Connor, attended the Old Church (now
the Cathedral) in great numbers.&nbsp; The authorities, having
been previously advised of their intention, had the military in
readiness to act, should the Chartists behave in a disorderly
manner: but they conducted themselves with great decorum.&nbsp;
It is said that, previous to Divine Service, they handed the
clergyman a Chartist text to preach from, but he selected as his
text, &ldquo;My house is the house of prayer, but ye have made it
a den of thieves&rdquo;; on announcing which, the Chartists rose,
and quitted the church.&nbsp; The same tactics were followed in
the principal towns all over the country, but, either from the
success of them not being very apparent, or from the
distastefulness of the method employed, the practice was not
followed up for long&mdash;nor with any great regularity.</p>
<p>On the 14th Sep. the Chartist National Convention was
dissolved; and, on the 20th Feargus O&rsquo;Connor was arrested
for sedition, on a Judge&rsquo;s Warrant, at Manchester, and
things were fairly quiet during the remainder of the year, with
the exception of a serious Chartist riot, on 4 Nov., at Newport,
in Monmouthshire, where many rioters were killed.</p>
<p>We have seen how, in the beginning of the year, the <i>Sun</i>
had prophesied the marriage of the Queen and Prince Albert, for
which it was duly pooh-poohed by the <i>Times</i>&mdash;but on 22
Aug., the <i>Morning Post</i> had the dreadful temerity to
announce the same&mdash;and the <i>Court Circular</i> of 11 Oct.
tells us, that &ldquo;The Hereditary Prince (Ernest) and Prince
Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, landed at the Tower, at 4
o&rsquo;clock yesterday afternoon, from the Continent.&nbsp;
Their Serene Highnesses were conveyed in two of the Royal landaus
to the Royal Mews at Pimlico, and, shortly afterwards, left town
<!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>with their suite in two carriages and four, for Windsor
Castle, on a visit to the Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 14th Oct., the Queen informed Lord Melbourne of her
intention to marry Prince Albert, which met with the
Premier&rsquo;s warm approbation.&nbsp; Next day she told the
Prince that she wished to marry him.&nbsp; He had been out early,
with his brother, hunting, but returned at twelve, and
half-an-hour afterwards, the Queen sent for him, and he found her
alone in her room.&nbsp; That it was a love match on both sides
is well known, and, until the untimely death of the Prince
Consort, they were models of conjugal love and felicity.</p>
<p>On 14 Nov. the Prince and his brother left Windsor&mdash;and
departed for the Continent, via Dover; and, at a Privy Council
held at Buckingham Palace on 23rd of that month, the Queen
communicated her intention of marriage.&nbsp; The declaration was
as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have caused you to be summoned at the
present time, in order that I may acquaint you with my resolution
in a matter which deeply concerns the welfare of my people, and
the happiness of my future life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my intention to ally myself in marriage with the
Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.&nbsp; Deeply impressed
with the solemnity of the engagement which I am about to
contract, I have not come to this decision without mature
consideration, nor without feeling a strong assurance that, with
the blessing of Almighty God, it will at once secure my domestic
felicity, and serve the interests of my country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought fit to make this resolution known to
you, at the earliest period, in order that you may be fully
apprised of a matter so highly important to me and to my Kingdom,
and which, I persuade myself, will be most acceptable to all my
loving subjects.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon this announcement, all the Privy Councillors present made
it their humble request that Her Majesty&rsquo;s most gracious
declaration to them might be made public; which Her Majesty was
pleased to order accordingly.</p>
<p><!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>The Queen suffered severely from lunatics.&nbsp; In
June a man got into the gardens of Buckingham Palace, and, when
arrested, declared he had come there for the sole purpose of
killing Her Majesty, and was duly committed to Tothill
Bridewell.&nbsp; Within a day or two of his release, in the
middle of October, he went to Windsor and broke three or four
panes of glass in the Castle.&nbsp; He was afterwards
apprehended, but what became of him, I do not know; in all
probability he was sent to a lunatic asylum.</p>
<p>In the paper which gives the account of the above, I read,
&ldquo;James Bryan, the Queen&rsquo;s Scotch suitor, was in
Windsor the whole of yesterday (Sunday, 13 Oct.).&nbsp; In the
morning, he was waiting, for a considerable period, at the door
of St. George&rsquo;s Chapel, leading to the Cloisters, to have a
view of the Queen, as Her Majesty and the two Princes of
Saxe-Coburg, and the Duchess of Kent left the Chapel.&nbsp; In
the afternoon, he walked on the Terrace, and conducted himself in
his usual manner, very respectfully bowing to the Queen, as Her
Majesty passed him on the New Terrace.&rdquo;&mdash;By the above,
he must have been well known.</p>
<p>On 29 Nov., a respectably-dressed man got over the high iron
gates leading to the Castle, a place at which there were no
sentries, and walked across the Park, to the grand entrance to
the Castle.&nbsp; Upon seeing the porter in attendance at the
lodge, he said: &ldquo;I demand entrance into the Castle as King
of England&rdquo;; to which the porter replied: &ldquo;Very well,
your Majesty, but be pleased to wait until I get my hat,&rdquo;
and then taking him to the Castle, handed him over to the
police.&nbsp; He turned out to be a man named Stockledge, who was
partner in an extensive wholesale business in Manchester.&nbsp;
He had been in two lunatic asylums, and when questioned by the
Mayor of Windsor, as to the object of his visit, said that:
&ldquo;he was like all other men who wanted wives&mdash;he was
looking after one,&rdquo; evidently alluding to Her
Majesty.&nbsp; On being further questioned, he said &ldquo;he was
the King of England, and was impelled by the Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He afterwards said that &ldquo;an unknown power had done
it,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it was the Spirit which helped him
over the gates.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course he <i>was</i> mad.</p>
<p><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>There was yet another fool this year, but, this time,
he was not a maniac&mdash;only a Post Office Clerk, who wanted to
have an interview with Her Majesty.&nbsp; On the afternoon of the
8th Dec., a carriage and four drove up to Windsor Castle, and,
from it, alighted a personage wearing a foraging cap, a fur boa
round his neck, and fur gloves, who announced himself as the
bearer of important despatches which he must deliver into the
Queen&rsquo;s own hands.&nbsp; This, of course, was not complied
with, and as he would not part with the documents, he was handed
over to the police, and taken to the station, where he made a
sturdy resistance when they were taken from him.&nbsp; He turned
out to be a junior clerk in the Foreign Post Office, named
William Saunders, who, being on duty when the Foreign Mails
arrived, found some letters and papers addressed to the Queen,
and put them into his pocket with the intention of delivering
them himself.&nbsp; He was suspended from his duties, but I do
not know his ultimate fate.</p>
<p>Gambling houses were still in existence, although the Police
Act of this year (2 &amp; 3 Vict., c. 47, s. 48) gave the police
great and additional power towards suppressing them.&nbsp; Here
is a sample raid as reported in the <i>Observer</i> of 15
Dec.:</p>
<p class="gutsumm">&ldquo;Superintendent Baker, C, succeeded on
Saturday night week, in breaking his way into a gambling house,
60 Jermyn Street (commonly called the Cottage), and some persons,
therein found, were fined, on Monday, at Marlborough Street
Office.&nbsp; In all, seven persons were captured, of whom, two
were connected with the management of the gambling house; the
others were gentlemen players.&nbsp; They were taken to the
Station house in Vine Street; and, as we know it to be the
anxious desire of the police authorities to suppress the nuisance
of gaming houses, we feel that we are but lending our humble aid
towards effecting that object in now publishing the real names of
those gentlemen who were captured, and who passed themselves off
to the police and the magistrate as being &lsquo;Jones,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Smith,&rsquo; and other conventional misnomers.&nbsp;
(Here follow the names.)&nbsp; Our Correspondent has told us of a
certain noble lord, who was running here and there, on the <!--
page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>night of the capture of his friends, striving, in the
first instance, to get them bailed out, and, failing in that, to
provide for them creature comforts in their cells.&nbsp; We
cannot avoid mentioning one or two little incidents connected
with this affair.&nbsp; The admission of spirits to prisoners in
a station house is strictly forbidden, but, on this occasion,
their friends outside succeeded in introducing eight soda water
bottles filled with excellent pale brandy, so regularly corked
and wired, as to deceive even the sharp eyes of the
Inspector.</p>
<p class="gutsumm">&ldquo;Next day (Sunday), at 12 o&rsquo;clock,
they were bailed out, but, on the following morning at
Marlborough Street Office, a sad mishap had all but blown up the
misnomers; for, when the name of &lsquo;Jones&rsquo; was called
from the police sheet, the gentleman who had honoured that name
by assuming it, quite forgot his condescension, until one of his
companions in trouble nudged him in the side, saying,
&lsquo;D---n it, that&rsquo;s you.&rsquo;&nbsp; By the way, the
croupier escaped through the skylight, with the bank, amounting,
it is supposed, to, at least, &pound;500.&nbsp; He, and a boy who
escaped with him, had but a minute or two the start of the
police.&nbsp; As it was, the croupier met with a most severe
accident, having cut his thigh so deeply as to cause a most
serious hemorrhage.&nbsp; The gutter was flooded with his
blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wind up the year by chronicling an event which, I fancy,
will never occur again, one of the most singular circumstances
connected with it being, that the penitent was a Jewess.&nbsp; It
occurs in a letter in the <i>Times</i> of 19 Dec.:</p>
<p style="text-align: right" class="gutsumm">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Act of Penance</span>, <span class="smcap">St.
John&rsquo;s</span>, <span class="smcap">Clerkenwell</span>.</p>
<p class="gutsumm">&ldquo;Sir.&mdash;Understanding that many
stories are afloat concerning the above act, performed on Sunday
last (15 Dec.) by a young woman of the Jewish persuasion, named
Deborah Cohen, I thought the particulars might be
acceptable.&nbsp; This affair appears to have arisen from some
family quarrel, the action in the Ecclesiastical Court, having
been brought against her by her brother, for having made use to
her sister-in-law, Rosetta Cohen, of a term contrary as well to
this part of our <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>laws, as to the usages of
society.&nbsp; To avoid expenses she had no means to meet, and
the consequences thereof, her solicitor advised her to admit her
fault, and abide the award of the Court.&nbsp; This having got
wind, the unpretending church of St. John&rsquo;s was beset,
early on Sunday last, by great crowds, amongst whom it required
great exertion of the parish officers and the police to preserve
a proper decorum.&nbsp; The crowds were, however, disappointed in
seeing this young woman exposed in the open church, with the
covering of a white sheet, etc., the order from the
Ecclesiastical Court only having enjoined her to appear in the
vestry room of this church, on Sunday morning last, after service
and a sermon, and before the minister, churchwardens, and five or
six of the plaintiff&rsquo;s friends (some of whom attended), to
recite, after the minister, her regret, etc., in the words laid
down in the order.&nbsp; This was carried into effect,
accordingly, the crowds in the church and St. John&rsquo;s Square
remaining long after the ceremony had been performed, and the
parties had left the vestry.</p>

established, one feature of which, the prepayment of letters, was
much appreciated by the public.&nbsp; The number of letters
despatched by the Mails from the Metropolis, on the 10th, was
much greater than was expected, amounting to 112,000, the daily
average for January, 1839, having been about 30,000 only.&nbsp;
Out of the 112,000 letters there were only 13,000 or 14,000
unpaid, and this was probably owing to the fact that people could
not get out of their old habits all at once.</p>
<p>The Postage Stamps, however, were not ready, for we read in
the <i>Times</i> of 17 Jan.: &ldquo;The construction of the
stamps is advancing with all speed, the several artists to whom
they are intrusted being actively engaged upon them.&nbsp; In the
stamp for letter paper and the adhesive stamp, a profile of the
Queen is the principal ornament.&nbsp; The letter paper stamp is
being engraved by Mr. Wyon, R.A., medallist to the Mint.&nbsp;
Charles Heath is engraving the drawing taken from Wyon&rsquo;s
City medal, by H. Corbould, intended for the adhesive
stamp.&nbsp; W. Mulready, R.A., has furnished the design for the
cover and envelope, which is in the hands of John Thompson for
engraving.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>And, now, until the Queen was married, all the talk was
of that event.&nbsp; First of all Prince Albert must be made a
naturalised Englishman, and a bill to that effect was read for
the third time in the House of Lords on 21 Jan., in the Commons
on the 22nd, and received the Royal Assent on the 24th. <a
name="citation119a"></a><a href="#footnote119a"
class="citation">[119a]</a>&nbsp; On the 23rd he was invested
with the Order of the Garter at Gotha.&nbsp; The second reading
of the Act for his naturalization was heard in the House of Lords
on the 27th, but owing to some dispute as to the question of his
precedence, it was adjourned until the 31st, when it was read,
and on 3 Feb. it was read a third time, and it received the Royal
Assent on 7 Feb.&nbsp; But there was another thing yet to be
done, which was to supply His Serene Highness with Funds, and on
Jan. 22 Lord John Russell proposed the sum of &pound;50,000 per
annum.&nbsp; The discussion thereon was adjourned until the 24th,
and re-adjourned until the 27th, when Mr. Hume moved a reduction
to &pound;21,000, which was lost by a majority of 267.&nbsp; Col.
Sibthorp then proposed a sum of &pound;30,000, which was agreed
to, and the Act received the Royal Assent on 7 Feb.</p>
<p>The feeling of the country on the subject of the Royal
Marriage is, to my thinking, very fairly summarised in a leading
article in the <i>Times</i> of 10 Feb., portions of which I
transcribe: &ldquo;It has followed from this policy, <a
name="citation119b"></a><a href="#footnote119b"
class="citation">[119b]</a> that an English monarch should,
<i>c&oelig;teris paribus</i>, rather avoid than court an alliance
with one of the first-rate powers of Europe, but should prefer
security to aggrandizement, satisfied with a consort selected
from a less prominent, and, therefore, less exposed,
position.&nbsp; If there be safety, therefore, in comparative
weakness and insignificance, we know not that, on such a ground,
any other princely house throughout Europe, could offer
inducements preferable to those possessed by those of
Saxe-Coburg.&nbsp; Objections against this individual member of
<!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>the family might, perhaps, present themselves to
reflecting minds, on the score of his close consanguinity to
Queen Victoria, a circumstance not usually looked upon as
propitious to the hope of a flourishing offspring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another argument might be urged against the match, from
the undoubted fact that the name of Saxe-Coburg is not popular in
this country, a misfortune for which we do not undertake to
account; nor shall we longer dwell upon either of the above
considerations, which we have hinted at, merely to shew that they
have not wholly escaped our notice. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince Albert has now become one of us.&nbsp; He is,
actually, now an English subject.&nbsp; He is tied to us by law
and self-interest.&nbsp; Let us bind him to us by gratitude and
affection.&nbsp; The happiness of our youthful Queen is now in
his hands.&nbsp; He has the means of so directing and assisting
her future footsteps, as to retrieve for Her Majesty (we speak
with frankness, but with all respect) all she has forfeited in
the hearts of the most loyal, enlightened and virtuous of her
subjects, through her unhappy bias towards persons and principles
which are hourly undermining the deep foundations of her
Throne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have said that it devolves upon Prince Albert to
counteract a host of &lsquo;evil influences,&rsquo; and to aid
his Royal Consort in repairing &lsquo;many very grievous
errors&rsquo; into which selfish and treacherous counsellors have
betrayed her, and which her constant separation (contrived by
them) from all but one section, or coterie of her subjects, has
served to render extremely difficult of correction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queen Victoria has scarcely been permitted to see the
general aspect of the British aristocracy, or to become
acquainted with their sentiments, their characters, or their
manners.&nbsp; The petty, artificial world framed and got up for
her deception, is no more capable of suggesting to her mind the
vast moral and social creation beyond its narrow boundaries, than
one or two leaves of a <i>hortus siccus</i> exemplify the
productions of a noble forest, or a varied and inimitable
landscape. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the heads of the nation to be discovered at the
Queen <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>of England&rsquo;s Court?&nbsp; Has
the worth, or wisdom, or eminence of the nation any access to the
society of the Sovereign?&nbsp; Have the clergy of England, or
any of them&mdash;have their representatives&mdash;bishops,
priests, or deacons, the opportunity of communicating personally
with the temporal head of the Church of England?&nbsp; Are they,
or any of them, ever seated at the Royal table, or received into
the Royal presence, or favoured with the Royal smile?&nbsp; No;
such associations comport not with the policy of her ministers;
the ear of the Sovereign is whispered from the choicest of her
subjects&mdash;the palace doors are locked inexorably against all
but a certain clique.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us turn from this little lecture to the Queen, honest and
faithful though it be, to the all-absorbing subject of Gossip,
the Royal Marriage&mdash;and first, and foremost, comes the Royal
Wedding Cake, which weighed nearly 300lbs.&nbsp; It was three
yards in circumference and about 14 inches deep.&nbsp; This was
the cake itself, which, according to a contemporary account,
&ldquo;is covered with sugar of the purest white; on the top is
seen the figure of Britannia in the act of blessing the
illustrious bride and bridegroom, who are dressed, somewhat
incongruously, in the costume of ancient Rome.&nbsp; These
figures are not quite a foot in height; at the feet of His Serene
Highness is the effigy of a dog, said to denote fidelity; and, at
the feet of the Queen is a pair of turtle doves, denoting the
felicities of the marriage state.&nbsp; A Cupid is writing in a
volume expanded on his knees, the date of the marriage, and
various other Cupids are sporting and enjoying themselves as such
interesting little individuals generally do.&nbsp; These little
figures are well modelled.&nbsp; On the top of the cake are
numerous bouquets of white flowers tied with true lover&rsquo;s
knots of white satin ribbon, intended for presents to the guests
at the nuptial breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 6 Feb. the Prince landed at Dover from Ostend, and on the
7th went to Canterbury; on the 8th he reached London and
Buckingham Palace; and, on the 10th they were married at the
Chapel Royal, St. James&rsquo;; spent the honeymoon at Windsor,
and made their <i>rentr&eacute;e</i> into society on 26 Feb.,
when they went, in State, to Drury Lane Theatre.</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>Duelling, although on the wane, was far from
dead.&nbsp; I could have given numerous instances of duels in the
earlier part of this reign, but have refrained, as they were of
no particular interest; but the following is an exception, as it
relates to one who, in after years, was to make a great name in
history for himself.</p>
<p><i>Times</i>, 4 March:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Bow
Street</span>.&mdash;Shortly after the opening of the court
yesterday morning, and before any of the night charges had been
disposed of, Prince Louis Napoleon and Le Comte Leon, who is said
to be the son of Bonaparte, to whom he hears a striking
resemblance, were brought before Mr. Jardine, charged by Nicholas
Pearce, inspector of the A division, with having met at Wimbledon
Common, and attempted to commit a breach of the peace, by
fighting a duel with swords and pistols.</p>
<p>Lieut.-Col. Jeremiah Ratcliffe, 6th Dragoons, as second to the
last defendant, and Col. Charles Parquin, second to the Prince,
together with Count D&rsquo;Orsay, and a servant, named Mertial
Kien, with aiding and assisting the principals in the intended
combat.</p>
<p>Previous to the evidence being taken, two brace of pistols,
with powder flasks, and a pair of rapiers, were laid on the table
for the inspection of the magistrate.</p>
<p>Inspector Pearce, being sworn, said, about 2 o&rsquo;clock
this morning he received information from Superintendent Baker,
that certain parties had an intention of meeting in a hostile
manner on Wimbledon Common, some of whom were to start from
Fenton&rsquo;s Hotel and the others from Carlton Gardens; in
consequence of which I went into St. James&rsquo;s Street, where
I saw a post-chaise drive up to the door of the hotel, about 7
o&rsquo;clock, but I could not ascertain if any person had got
into it.&nbsp; After delaying a short time, it moved slowly on in
the direction of Piccadilly, followed by Col. Ratcliffe, and
stopped again at Tattersall&rsquo;s, where another person
followed towards Hyde Park Corner.&nbsp; The chaise was then
driven westward, and I followed it on horseback; but, previous to
arriving <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>at Hyde Park Corner, the defendant
Ratcliffe passed, on horseback, in Piccadilly.</p>
<p>Mr. Jardine: What hour might it be then?</p>
<p>Witness: It was then nearly 7 o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; On arriving
at the Common, I saw the entire party collected near to the
Windmill, and the post-chaise proceeding in that direction.&nbsp;
Having dismounted, and left the horse in the care of a
countryman, I proceeded to where the chaises were standing, and
then I saw the defendants walking away, from them, some yards
down, to a hollow part of the ground, each party apparently
making arrangements about the duel.&nbsp; They then stopped, and
as I approached Col. Parquin, seeing two letters in one hand, and
the two swords produced, in the other, I took them from
him.&nbsp; At that time, the pistols produced, in a case, were
lying on the ground, near to another brace, which were wrapped up
in paper.&nbsp; Some conversation passed between Count
D&rsquo;Orsay and Col. Parquin, which appeared to be whether the
combat was to be fought with pistols or with swords, and the
Count asked me what I wanted; my authority for interfering; and
who it was that gave me information of the circumstance.&nbsp; At
that moment, Inspector Partridge, accompanied by Sergt. Otway and
other constables, came up, and, on Col. Ratcliffe taking the
pistols from the case, he was taken into custody.&nbsp; I
instantly went to him, and, shewing him my staff, told him I was
an officer, and that I was, in duty, bound to take him into
custody, for attempting to commit a breach of the peace.&nbsp;
Count D&rsquo;Orsay requested to be told who it was who had given
the information, and, on being refused, the entire party were
quietly conveyed to the station house.</p>
<p>Mr. Jardine: Have you since ascertained that the pistols
contained powder and balls?</p>
<p>Witness: Yes, Sir; there are balls in them, and caps upon
them.</p>
<p>Colonel Ratcliffe declared there was no powder in the pistols,
which belonged to him, as could be seen; for it had been arranged
that the duel was to be fought with swords.</p>
<p>Mr. Jardine inquired if any of the defendants, who were <!--
page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>foreigners, and not sufficiently conversant with the
English language, would wish to hear the evidence read over to
them in French?</p>
<p>Le Comte Leon replied in French, that he could not
sufficiently understand the evidence that had been given, but he
was quite satisfied that all the proceedings were perfectly legal
and correct.</p>
<p>Prince Louis said, he was prepared, if required, to enter into
an explanation of the circumstances which gave rise to the
offence with which he was charged.</p>
<p>Mr. Jardine did not wish to hear any statement on either side,
as his duty was only to prevent a breach of the peace, and he
hoped the defendants were prepared with the sureties he would
require, to prevent further inconvenience.</p>
<p>Count D&rsquo;Orsay said, he had come prepared with bail,
which he thought there could be no objection to.</p>
<p>Prince Louis requested that the two letters, which had been
taken from his friend, should be delivered up to him.</p>
<p>Mr. Jardine immediately delivered up the letters, saying he
should require the principals to enter into bail, themselves in
&pound;500 each, and two sureties in &pound;250 each, to keep the
peace with all Her Majesty&rsquo;s subjects, and particularly
with each other, for the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Count D&rsquo;Orsay: One surety in &pound;500, would, perhaps,
answer as well as two in &pound;250 each, if it meets with your
approbation.</p>
<p>Mr. Jardine said he had no objection to such a course, and, if
the other defendants were prepared with bail, it might be
taken.</p>
<p>Col. Ratcliffe said his surety was present.</p>
<p>Mr. Jardine: The bail I shall require is, that each of the
other defendants enter into his own recognizance in &pound;100,
and two sureties in &pound;50 each, to keep the peace for the
same period, with the exception of the defendant Kien, who may
put in his own recognizances in &pound;100.</p>
<p>Mr. Joshua Bates, of Portland Place, having offered himself as
surety for Prince Louis Napoleon and Col. Parquin, was
accepted.</p>
<p>Mr. Fenton was accepted as bail for Le Comte Leon, and <!--
page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>the Hon. Francis Baring, M.P., became surety for Col.
Ratcliffe and Count D&rsquo;Orsay.</p>
<p>The Chief Clerk having conducted the parties into the
Magistrate&rsquo;s private room, where they were furnished with
the requisite notices, returned to the Court to take directions
respecting the disposal of the weapons and other articles which
were found upon the defendants on their being taken into
custody.</p>
<p>Mr. Jardine said he could make no order about them, but he
thought that, as the defendants had put in bail, there could be
very little apprehension of their committing a similar offence,
if they were restored to their proper owners.</p>
<p>It appeared that the two letters had been written by the Comte
Leon to his cousin, as he was styled, demanding that he would
retract certain expressions respecting their relationship, which
he was alleged to have made use of; and, his not complying, gave
rise to the quarrel.</p>
<p>On the 10th of April the offer of Messrs. Grissell and Peto
was accepted, to erect the Nelson Column in Trafalgar Square,
within two years, for a sum of &pound;17,860.</p>
<p>There is a curious police case as to the habits and customs of
Noblemen&rsquo;s servants, which may be interesting to my
readers.&nbsp; It was brought before the Magistrate at Queen
Square on 14 April, when the House Steward of the Earl of
Galloway applied for summonses against the footmen attending the
carriages of Viscount Melbourne, the Marquis of Normanby, the
Marquis of Lansdowne and Lord Tankerville, for assault and
damage.</p>
<p>It appeared from the statement of the applicant, that the
servants attending the carriages of peers, to the House of Lords,
have a waiting room, which they call their Club room, and that
they have formed themselves into a society, governed by one of
their body, whom they call their &ldquo;Constable.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They have a set of rules, dated as far back as 1759, obedience to
which is strictly enforced under pain of certain fines.</p>
<p>On Friday evening, the coachman of the Earl of Galloway set
his lordship down at the House of Lords, with orders <!-- page
126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>to
wait.&nbsp; The footman, who was, it appears, a new comer, was,
on entering the club room, called upon to pay a fine, or
&ldquo;footing&rdquo; of two shillings, to be spent in beer, but
he replied that he had no money about him; and, on their
insisting on its being paid, he left the room, and got on the
carriage box, with the coachman, but the &ldquo;members,&rdquo;
headed by their Constable, with his staff of office, pursued him,
insisted upon his coming down, and were about to pull him off the
box, when the coachman told them that his fellow servant had no
money with him, but, if they would go, he would be answerable
that it should be paid.&nbsp; They, however, insisted that it
should be spent in their Club, and that the new servant should be
present.</p>
<p>Mr. Burrell: How many were there of them?</p>
<p>Applicant said there were, he understood, 10 or 12, but it was
only intended to proceed against the four ringleaders.&nbsp; The
coachman, finding that they were determined to have his fellow
servant off the box, drove on a little way, and, on returning to
his place, Lord Normanby&rsquo;s carriage ran against his, and
seriously damaged it.&nbsp; The footman was, at length, dragged
from the box, and very roughly handled: his foot was hurt.&nbsp;
The coachman was also struck with the long &ldquo;staff&rdquo;
carried by the &ldquo;constable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Samuel Linturn, the footman, corroborated this statement.</p>
<p>The summonses were granted.</p>
<p>It was stated that Lord Normanby, at once, offered to make
good the damage done, but this the Earl of Galloway declined,
having determined that the whole matter should be publicly
investigated by a magistrate.</p>
<p>Two days afterwards, four footmen in the employ of Lords
Melbourne, Lansdowne, Normanby and Tankerville appeared to answer
the summonses.</p>
<p>The complainant, in the course of his evidence, said that he
had been to the House of Lords on several previous occasions, but
had never been asked for anything, nor did he even know of the
existence of such a room.&nbsp; Turk asked him whose servant he
was, but he refused to tell him.&nbsp; Turk, at the time, had, in
his hand, a pointed stick, which he called <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>a staff; he
made no demand for money then, but went away, and the complainant
got on the box with the coachman, who took the coach to the
stand.&nbsp; Turk, accompanied by several others, then came
up.&nbsp; The Marquis of Bute&rsquo;s footman said he would pay
the fine, or footing, and placed two shillings on the footboard
of the carriage for that purpose.&nbsp; This did not satisfy
them.&nbsp; Several persons, amongst whom were the defendants,
got upon the coach, and swore that if he did not come down, they
would pull him down.&nbsp; There were several police about, and,
although he called upon them for assistance, they would not
come.</p>
<p>Both he and the coachman told them that he had no money, and
the coachman said he would secure them payment, if they would go
and drink the beer, but they insisted upon the
complainant&rsquo;s presence in the &ldquo;club.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
still refused, and then they brought a long pole, which they
called a &ldquo;horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; The coachman drove up
Abingdon Street to avoid them, but several of the carriages drew
out of the rank, and followed them, and, as the coachman turned
to regain his station, Lord Normanby&rsquo;s carriage was driven
against him, and the Earl of Galloway&rsquo;s carriage sustained
considerable damage; it was forced on the footway, and was
obliged to stop, upon which, several of the footmen ran, and
seized the horses by their heads.&nbsp; The defendants dragged
the complainant off the box; one had hold of his foot, and
another, who seized upon his greatcoat, tore the buttons from it,
and from his gaiters and breeches.&nbsp; They then placed him
upon the pole, which they called &ldquo;putting him on
horseback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They then rode him into the room mentioned, where Lord
Holland&rsquo;s footman sat as chairman, and decided that he
should pay two shillings.&nbsp; He borrowed the money from Lord
Lansdowne&rsquo;s servant, and was about to leave the room, but
he was forced to resume his seat, as he was told he could, from
the room, easily hear when the carriage was called, and that
&ldquo;he must sit and drink his beer.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was also
told that he was now sworn in, and had only to kiss the staff,
which was presented to him, but he refused to do it.&nbsp; He was
detained three-quarters of an hour, against his will.&nbsp; His
<!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>foot was hurt, and the coachman was injured by a blow
from the &ldquo;staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coachman corroborated the evidence, and the defendants
were fined ten shillings each.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 29th April, there was an uproar in the Italian Opera
House, which might have expanded into another O.P. riot of
1809.&nbsp; The Impresario, M. Laporte, had not engaged
Tamburini, because his terms were too high, and the
singer&rsquo;s friends were highly indignant.&nbsp; On this
evening, at the conclusion of the opera of <i>I Puritani</i>,
several voices began calling for M. Laporte, with shouts of
&ldquo;Tamburini!&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor M. Laporte appeared and began
a speech in which he sought to excuse himself, but it was drowned
by a torrent of groans and hisses, which came, principally, from
the occupants of the &ldquo;omnibus&rdquo; box. <a
name="citation128"></a><a href="#footnote128"
class="citation">[128]</a>&nbsp; M. Laporte so clearly perceived
this, that, in a few minutes, his speech to the audience merged
into a private conversation with its occupants.&nbsp; The noise
increased, and M. Laporte declared that he was not to be
&ldquo;intimidated,&rdquo; a word which roused the
&ldquo;omnibus&rdquo; party to perfect fury.&nbsp; He retired,
and the curtain rose for the ballet, in which a new dancer was to
have made her appearance.&nbsp; The noise, now, became terrible;
yells, hisses, and all sorts of uncouth sounds were blended in
frightful discord.&nbsp; The dancers, perceiving all attempts at
a performance were in vain, and, at the same time, being afraid
to quit the stage, sat quietly, all round.</p>
<p>Again and again Laporte came forward, and tried to bring
matters to a settlement, and once he ventured to say, that, as
manager, he had a right to engage performers at his own
discretion, and that he was not to be responsible to an
audience&mdash;which, it is needless to say, added fuel to
fire.&nbsp; Then he told them his engagements would not allow him
to employ Tamburini, which meant ruin to him, but it only
provoked more noise.&nbsp; Then he appealed to their better
feelings by telling them of the many years he had catered for
their amusement, and this did bring him some support, for cries
of <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>&ldquo;Shame,&rdquo; &ldquo;No Tamburini,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;No Intimidation,&rdquo; were heard, but this only had the
effect of dividing the audience, and increasing the hubbub.</p>
<p>Once again poor Laporte came forward, and talked of engaging
Tamburini on &ldquo;Conditions.&rdquo;&nbsp; This word upset all,
and the Tamburinists asked: &ldquo;Will you engage him?&nbsp;
Yes, or No?&rdquo;&nbsp; Laporte said he would make proposals,
and, if those proposals, etc.&nbsp; This would not do;
&ldquo;Yes, or No?&rdquo; said his persevering
interrogators.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say &lsquo;No,&rsquo;&rdquo; said his
supporters.&nbsp; He began talking about terms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Same
terms as last year,&rdquo; shouted all the &ldquo;Omnibus&rdquo;
party, upon which he retired, without proposing anything
satisfactory.&nbsp; Everyone was getting tired, when, at last, a
gentleman, in a box opposite the &ldquo;Omnibus,&rdquo; stepped
over the front of his box on to the stage, and was followed by a
party; the &ldquo;Omnibus&rdquo; party entered the stage from the
opposite side, and, at one o&rsquo;clock, the Tamburinists had
taken possession, and waved their hats triumphantly, on the
stage, as the curtain fell.</p>
<p>It was this episode that the Rev. R. H. Barham has
immortalized in his <i>Ingoldsby Legends</i>, under the title of
&ldquo;A Row in an Omnibus (box),&rdquo; beginning:</p>
<blockquote><p>Doldrum the Manager sits in his chair,<br />
With a gloomy brow and dissatisfied air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he says, as he slaps his hand on his knee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have nothing to do with
Fiddle-de-dee!</p>
<p>&lsquo;&mdash;But Fiddle-de-dee sings clear and loud,<br />
And his trills and his quavers astonish the crowd.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a singer as he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll nowhere see,<br />
They&rsquo;ll all be screaming for Fiddle-de-dee!</p>
<p>&lsquo;&mdash;Though Fiddle-de-dee sings loud and clear,<br />
And his tones are sweet, yet his terms are dear!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glove won&rsquo;t fit!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deuce a bit.<br />
I shall give an engagement to Fal-de-ral-tit!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

say we never beheld anything more ludicrous than the figures or

scarcely produce anything so laughable.&nbsp; It is, apparently,
a spirited attempt to imitate the hieroglyphic which formed one
of the ornaments to <i>Moore&rsquo;s Almanack</i>; Britannia is
seated in the centre, with the lion couchant (Whiggish) at her
feet; her arms are extended, scattering little flying children to
some elephants on the left; and, on the right, to a group of
gentlemen, some of whom, at all events, are not enclosed in
<i>envelopes</i>, writing on their knees, evidently on account of
a paucity of tables.&nbsp; There are, besides, sundry figures,
who, if they were to appear in the streets of London, or any of
our highways, would be liable to the penalties of the Vagrant Act
for indecent exposure.&nbsp; Under the tableland by which these
figures are supported, some evidence of a laudable curiosity is
depicted, by three or four ladies, who are represented reading a
billet doux, or valentine, and some little boys, evidently
learning <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span

which their anxious faces disclose.&nbsp; One serious omission we

<p>As a matter of fact, it was so universally disapproved of by
the public, and was the object of so much ridicule, as to <!--
page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>necessitate the destruction of nearly all the vast
number prepared for issue.&nbsp; To do this, a machine had to be
specially constructed; the attempt to do the work by fire, in
close stoves (fear of robbery forbade the use of open ones),
having absolutely failed.&nbsp; They are now somewhat scarce, but
are extensively forged.&nbsp; It was satirized and laughed at by
all, and a contemporary criticism, which has been reproduced in
<i>The Philatelist</i>, vol. vii., p. 145, is very amusing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Britannia is sending her messengers

To the East, to the West, to the South, to the North:<br />

<p>There were very many pictorial satires on this unfortunate
wrapper, but none bore so near a resemblance to it as the
accompanying illustration by John Doyle (H.B. Sketches, 26 May,
1840, No. 639).&nbsp; Lord Palmerston, as Britannia, is
dispatching Mercuries with fire and sword, to the east, typical
of the wars in Egypt and China.&nbsp; On the other hand, he sends
a flight of Cupids to Father Mathew, the apostle of Temperance,
who was then doing such good work in Ireland, whilst a man is
knocking the bung out of a whisky barrel.&nbsp; Beneath this
group is O&rsquo;Connell, who is roaring out &ldquo;Hurrah for
Repeal!&rdquo; to the horror of the Duke of Wellington, who is
behind him.&nbsp; On the left is Lord Monteagle, late Chancellor
of the Exchequer, ill in bed; whilst his successor, Mr. Baring,
reads to him the result of his policy: &ldquo;Post Office
deliveries in the quarter, &pound;272,000!&nbsp; Total deficiency
in the year, to be made up by new taxation,
&pound;2,000,000!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 7 May, the Gresham Committee met to decide on the two plans
for the New Royal Exchange, one prepared by Mr. Cockerell, R.A.,
and the other by Mr. Tite, President of the Architectural
Society, which was in favour of the latter by 13 votes to
7.&nbsp; The works were immediately proceeded with.</p>
<p>Talking of one fire seems to lead on to another, for on 20
May, York Minster was for the second time visited with a
conflagration&mdash;this time, however, it was caused
accidentally, and not the work of an incendiary.</p>
<p>The following extract from a letter dated York, 21 May, gives
a graphic account of the fire, and is of especial interest, as
being from the pen of a spectator.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You may hear the rumour of the alarming and
truly awful calamity that has occurred in this city, before you
receive this.&nbsp; <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>I have witnessed it, and shall hold
the recollection as long as my memory exists.&nbsp; About 20
minutes to 9 last evening, I was told the Minster was on
fire.&nbsp; I ran out, immediately, towards it, and stood by it,
just as the flames had issued from the top part of the south-west
tower, at a height that an engine could not have played
upon.&nbsp; The fire continued to rage until it had entire
possession of the upper part; flames issuing from every window,
and piercing the roof.&nbsp; To describe the feelings under which
I witnessed the devouring flames preying upon a national
monument, which every man must look upon with admiration,
requires a pen more descriptive than mine.&nbsp; Grief, awe,
wonder and admiration were the emotions with which I regarded the
destruction of this venerable church.&nbsp; I soon obtained
admission into the nave of the Cathedral, and observed the first
falling down of the burnt embers.&nbsp; The flames illumined the
interior with more than mid-day brightness; the light, pouring
through the crevices, threw a brilliancy over the scene which
imagination cannot paint.&nbsp; The fire, at this time, was
wholly confined to the tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the space of half an hour, the flooring of the
belfry in the tower began to be forced by the falling bells and
lighted beams.&nbsp; At this period, my nerves were strung to the
highest excitement.&nbsp; The noise was extraordinary.&nbsp; The
shouting of the firemen, the roaring of the flames rushing up the
tower with the rapidity of a furnace draught, sounded in the high
and arched space, awful and terrific.&nbsp; The falling masses of
wood, and bells, sounded like the near discharge of artillery,
and were echoed back from the dark passages, whose glomy shade,
and hollow responses seemed mourning at the funeral pile that
burned so fiercely.&nbsp; In one hour, the tower was completely
gutted, and masses of burning timber lay piled against the
south-west door.&nbsp; The upper and under roof, composed
principally of fir timber, covering the nave, as far as the
centre tower, had, by this time, become fired, and burned with
extraordinary rapidity.&nbsp; The firemen, by a well-managed
direction of the water, prevented the flames passing through the
west windows of the centre tower, and continued <!-- page
136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>their exertions at that spot, until the whole of the
roof had fallen in, and lay, in the centre of the aisle, a sea of
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The west doors had, now, become nearly burnt through,
and planks were brought to barricade them, and prevent the
rushing of air to fan the embers to flame, which might have
communicated to the organ, and thence, throughout the whole pile
of buildings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At 1 o&rsquo;clock, this morning, I again entered the
Cathedral, and then concluded there was no further danger of
destruction.&nbsp; The tower is standing, also the walls and
pillars of the nave; and, beyond that, the building, I am happy
to state, is saved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire is supposed to have originated from a clock
maker, who has been, for some time past, occupied in repairing
the clock in that tower, who might accidentally, have dropped a
spark from a candle.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The repairs in 1829, when the Cathedral was fired by the
fanatic, John Martin, cost &pound;65,000, which was raised by
subscription, and it was estimated that the cost of the present
repairs would amount to about &pound;20,000.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I know of no other general topic of conversation in May, but,
in June, there was one which set every one in the United Kingdom,
and the whole civilized world, a talking.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">The Queen had been Shot at</span>!!!&nbsp; A little
after 6 p.m. the Queen and Prince Albert left Buckingham Palace
for their before-dinner drive, and had barely got one-third up
Constitution Hill, when a young man, who had been walking
backwards and forwards, as the carriage came near, and was nearly
opposite him, turned round, and, drawing a pistol from his
breast, fired at the carriage, which, however, went on its
way.&nbsp; The man then looked back, to see whether any person
was standing near enough to prevent him, and drew another pistol,
which he discharged at the carriage.&nbsp; Prince Albert ordered
the postillions to drive on, and they went as far as Hyde Park
Corner, and thence to the Duchess of Kent&rsquo;s mansion in
Belgrave Square, and, after staying there some little time, drove
to Buckingham Palace, where the Queen was <!-- page 137--><a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>received by
crowds of her subjects, cheering vociferously.&nbsp; To say that
she was not affected by the incident would not be true, but she
soon recovered from its effects.</p>
<p>The person who shot at her was a little undersized boy (5ft.
4in.), about 18, named Edward Oxford, a publican&rsquo;s barman,
out of work, and as &ldquo;Satan finds work for idle hands to
do,&rdquo; this boy must needs buy two pistols, bullets, powder
and caps, and begin practising shooting.&nbsp; Whatever made it
enter into his wicked little head to shoot at the Queen, no one
knew, but he did, and was speedily in the hands of the
police.&nbsp; He was examined and re-examined, and finally tried
at the Central Criminal Court on 9 July, the trial lasting two
days.&nbsp; The defence was the plea of insanity, and, as no
bullets could be found, the jury brought in a verdict of
&ldquo;Guilty, he being, at the time, insane&rdquo;; and, in
accordance with such verdict, the judge sentenced him to be
imprisoned during Her Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure.</p>
<p>On the day after being shot at, the Queen and Prince Albert
took their wonted drive in the Park, amidst the shouts of crowded
thousands, and the next day, she, in State, received the
congratulations of the Houses of Lords and Commons, the latter
having the first audience.&nbsp; At two o&rsquo;clock, the state
carriage of the Speaker entered the court, followed by 109
carriages filled with members of the House of Commons; never
before, it was said, was the Speaker followed by so numerous a
<i>cort&egrave;ge</i>, on the occasion of presenting an
address.&nbsp; As soon as the carriages of the Commons had left
the court, the procession of the Lords began to enter, the barons
first, then the other peers, rising in rank to the royal
dukes.&nbsp; They wore all their stars and garters, and made a
brave show.</p>
<p>We get a glimpse of Oxford in prison in a paragraph of the
<i>Times</i>, 28 Feb., 1843, copied from a Sunday paper.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As numberless strange and conflicting
rumours have been propagated, relative to the treatment
experienced by Edward Oxford, in his place of incarceration, the
curiosity of the visitor on this head was, naturally, great,
especially as it is generally understood that those who are
favoured with permission <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>to visit
Bethlehem, are not allowed to see Oxford.&nbsp; This is not,
however, the fact.&nbsp; In a compartment of the establishment,
principally allotted to those who are supposed to have committed
heinous crimes in moments of madness, Edward Oxford is
confined.&nbsp; He is not separated from the other unfortunate
persons who reside in that division of the building, but is
allowed free intercourse with them.&nbsp; Among his comrades are
Mr. Pierce, surgeon, who shot his wife whilst labouring under a
paroxysm of madness produced by jealousy; and Captain Good, whose
favourite phantasy is the assumption of the attribute of
Majesty.&nbsp; There is, in the same division of the
establishment, a very diminutive man, who imagines himself to be
Lord John Russell.&nbsp; He amuses himself, nearly all day long,
with knitting.&nbsp; Captain Good is fond of smoking, and Pierce
hovers over the fireplace (a stove) all day.&nbsp; Oxford diverts
himself with drawing and reading.&nbsp; He told the visitor, who
furnished us with this account, that he had taught himself to
read French with ease, during his incarceration, but that he was
unable to speak the language, for want of an opportunity of
studying the pronunciation.&nbsp; He said that he was terribly
tired of his sojourn at Bethlehem, and that he wished he could
obtain his liberty, even though he should be placed under
<i>surveillance</i> during the remainder of his life.&nbsp; The
visitor remarked that there was no such thing as <i>surveillance
de police</i> in England.&nbsp; To which Oxford replied that he
was perfectly acquainted with that fact; and that the condition
upon which he thus desired his liberty, was rather an imaginary
one, than a strictly legal and feasible one.&nbsp; Upon another
question being put to him, he said he knew he had been placed in
Bethlehem under an impression that he was mad, but that he was,
really, very far from being mad.&nbsp; He exhibited some of his
drawings, which were uncommonly well executed, and evinced a
natural talent for the art.&nbsp; There were a view of
Abbotsford, a horse&rsquo;s head, a portrait of the Virgin Mary,
and one or two other designs, which were, really, most tastefully
sketched and shaded.&nbsp; He appeared pleased when complimented
on his proficiency in the art of drawing, and observed that he
was self-taught.&nbsp; In <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>manners, he
is modest, civil and unassuming, and certainly exhibits not the
slightest symptom of insanity.&nbsp; We know that medical
jurisprudence admits that it is very difficult to determine the
exact line of demarcation where sound sense stops, and insanity
commences; but he, who has visited a receptacle for the insane,
will speedily observe the strange state and appearance of the
eyes of those whose intellects are unhinged.&nbsp; This
appearance cannot be mistaken either in lucid or rabid intervals;
it is still perceptible, although, of course, in a greater or
lesser degree.&nbsp; Now, the visitor to Bethlehem, on the
occasion here refered to, particularly observed the eyes of all
the inmates; and those of one only showed not the least&mdash;not
the most remote symptoms of insanity.&nbsp; This one individual
was Edward Oxford.&nbsp; He appears in his conversation, his
manners, his countenance and his pursuits, as sane, collected,
and intelligent as possible.&nbsp; Of course, the deed for which
he is now in durance was not touched upon; nor was any
information relative to that subject sought of the turnkeys, or
keepers.&nbsp; With respect to food, Oxford is not treated one
atom better than his fellow sufferers; the diet of the inmates of
the hospital is plentiful and good, but no favour is shown to any
particular individual, with regard either to quality, or
quantity.&nbsp; Oxford appears to enjoy very excellent health;
and he is remarkably clean and neat in his person.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was, afterwards, removed to Broadmoor, and I have been
told, although I cannot vouch for the fact, that he was liberated
some years ago, and sent to Australia.</p>
<p>Early in July, we begin to hear of a higher style of farming
than that previously in use, as we find the <i>Dumfries
Courier</i> advocating the use of nitrate of soda as a manure,
but, yet, are cautious on the subject.&mdash;&ldquo;An extensive
trial of it will be necessary before any proper judgment can be
pronounced.&nbsp; It is, as yet, unknown whether its effects are
lasting, and until this is ascertained, caution must be
used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another thing, too, was just beginning to attract
attention&mdash;Electro-metallurgy.&nbsp; True it is that
Wollaston applied the <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>principle of the Voltaic pile to the
deposition of one metal upon another in 1801, and it was further
developed by Bessemer (1834), Jacobi and the Elkingtons in 1838,
and Spencer in 1839, but for practical utility it was still in
its infancy, and we can see how far it had advanced, in the
following extract from a German Paper: &ldquo;Munich, 22 July,
1840.&mdash;Much is at present said in the public papers
respecting the imitations of medals, reliefs, etc., by means of a
galvanic deposition of copper.&nbsp; This art, called Galvano
plastic, first discovered by Professor Jacobi of St. Petersburg,
and brought to greater perfection by Mr. Spencer, of Liverpool,
and by Professor Von Kebel, of Munich, may justly be classed as
one of the most useful of modern inventions; and, from its great
importance, its employment in technical operations must soon
become general.&nbsp; Indeed, some persons in England, perceiving
the great influence which this invention is destined to have on
manufacturing industry, are already applying it to the production
of buttons, arabesques, and various ornaments in Copper.&nbsp;
Herr G. A. Muller, mechanician of Leipsic, has recently called
attention to the application of Galvano plastic to
typography.&nbsp; He has, however, been, in some measure,
anticipated by the experiments made in 1839, in Rosel&rsquo;s
printing office, in Munich; where, by following the methods of
Jacobi and Spencer, the lines of copperplate were produced in
relief.&nbsp; Wood cuts were, also, converted into metallic
plates, which, to say nothing of the advantage of the solidity of
the metal, far exceeded the effect of the most perfect
casting.&nbsp; The experiments for making stereotype plates in
copper have, also, been successful.&nbsp; In short, the invention
has now reached that stage which must secure for it the attention
of all practical men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mulready&rsquo;s postal wrapper having been killed by
universal derision: in July was produced an envelope with an
embossed head of the Queen thereon, and these could be bought
until the close of her reign.</p>
<p>Prince Louis Napoleon, previously to his ill-starred
expedition to Boulogne, had left instructions for his furniture
and jewellery to be sold; and sold they accordingly were by <!--

other <i>virtuosi</i> went to the sale to see what Napoleonic
relics they could pick up.&nbsp; Among these were two silver
cups, with the eagle and initial of Queen Hortense, &pound;5 10/-
and a casket of camei, formerly the property of the Empress
Josephine, was divided into 22 lots, one of which was a pair of
earrings, the gift of Pius VI. to Josephine during the first
campaign in Italy, in 1796, sold for &pound;46 4/-, and the
original marble bust of Napoleon, when Consul, dated 1804, by
Canova, fetched &pound;232 11/-.</p>
<p>On 28 Aug. Prince Albert received the freedom of the City of
London; and, on 11 Sep., he was made a Privy Councillor.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Lord Cardigan and the &ldquo;Black
bottle&rdquo; case&mdash;Lord Cardigan&rsquo;s duel with Lieut.
Tuckett&mdash;Steam to India&mdash;Nelson
Column&mdash;Mormonism&mdash;&ldquo;The Boy
Jones&rdquo;&mdash;Napoleon&rsquo;s body transferred to
France.</p>
<p>About this time the Earl of Cardigan made himself particularly
conspicuous before the public, and the commencement of it was the
famous &ldquo;black bottle&rdquo; question, and I well remember
that that useful utensil was, for many years, called a
&ldquo;Cardigan.&rdquo;&nbsp; My Lord was Colonel of the 11th
Hussars, &ldquo;Prince Albert&rsquo;s Own,&rdquo; and it so
happened that, on the 18th May, 1840, when the Inspecting Officer
dined with the mess, Captain Reynolds of &ldquo;Ours&rdquo;
ordered, at mess, a bottle of Moselle, which, instead of being
decanted, was served in its original envelope, a proceeding which
gave offence to the aristocratic taste of the Colonel, and,
according to a statement which was published in many
newspapers:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The following morning Capt. Jones delivered
the following message to Capt. Reynolds: &lsquo;The Colonel has
desired me, as president of the mess committee, to tell you that
you were wrong in having a black bottle placed on the table, at a
great dinner like last night, as the mess should be conducted
like a gentleman&rsquo;s table, and not like a tavern, or
pothouse,&rsquo; or words to that effect.&nbsp; Capt. Reynolds
received the message with astonishment, but without remark, and,
subsequently, waited on the Earl of Cardigan, and complained of
it, but received no satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A short time afterwards, Capt. Reynolds met Capt. Jones
in the mess-room, and, in the presence of two officers, said to
him: &lsquo;Captain Jones, I wish to speak to you about the <!--
page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>message you brought me this morning.&nbsp; In the first
place, I do not think you were justified in giving it at all; as
a brother captain, having no possible control over me, it would
have been better taste if you had declined to deliver
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; He replied: &lsquo;I received it from the
Commanding Officer, and, as such, I gave it; and, if you refuse
to receive it from me, I shall report it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Capt.
Reynolds replied: &lsquo;Do not misunderstand me, Captain Jones;
I have received, and do receive it; but the message was an
offensive one; and I tell you, once for all, that, in future, I
will not allow you, or any man, to bring me offensive
messages.&rsquo;&nbsp; Capt. Jones said: &lsquo;If I am ordered
to give a message, I shall give it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Capt. Reynolds
said: &lsquo;Well, you may do as you please; but if you bring me
improper messages, you must take the consequences.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Capt. Jones replied, &lsquo;he should certainly do so,&rsquo; and
left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two captains who were present (one not an officer
of the regiment) proved that Capt. Reynolds&rsquo; manner was
quiet and inoffensive.&nbsp; Capt. Jones reported the
conversation; and, soon afterwards, Capt. Reynolds was summoned
to the orderly room; where, in presence of Major Jenkins, the
adjutant, and Capt. Jones, Lord Cardigan thus addressed Capt.
Reynolds, in no very agreeable tone, or manner: &lsquo;If you
cannot behave quietly, Sir, why don&rsquo;t you leave the
regiment?&nbsp; This is just the way with you Indian officers;
you think you know everything; but I tell you, Sir, that you
neither know your duty, nor discipline.&nbsp; Oh, yes, you do
know your duty, I believe, but you have no idea whatever of
discipline, and do not, at all, justify my
recommendation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Capt. Reynolds remained silent; when
Lord Cardigan added, &lsquo;Well, I put you in arrest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capt. Jones then offered Capt. Reynolds his hand, upon
which, Capt. Reynolds, turning towards him, said, &lsquo;No,
Capt. Jones, I will not shake hands with you; nothing has passed
which renders it necessary.&nbsp; I have no quarrel with you, and
I deny having insulted you, and see no reason why I should shake
hands with you, or the contrary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Cardigan said, &lsquo;But I say you have insulted
Capt. Jones.&rsquo;&nbsp; Capt. Reynolds quietly replied,
&lsquo;I have not, my <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>Lord&rsquo;; upon which Lord
Cardigan said, &lsquo;Well, I put you under arrest, and shall
report the matter to the Horse Guards.&rsquo;&nbsp; Capt.
Reynolds said, &lsquo;I am sorry for it;&rsquo; and retired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter was reported to the Horse Guards, after
Capt. Reynolds had been in close arrest three days.&nbsp; Lord
Hill sent a memorandum, recommending Capt. Reynolds to
acknowledge the impropriety of his conduct towards Lord Cardigan,
and to declare his readiness to resume friendly intercourse with
Capt. Jones.&nbsp; This recommendation Capt. Reynolds obeyed; but
he still refused to shake hands with Capt. Jones, which would
seem to imply a previous quarrel, or to drink wine with him
within any specified time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 9th of June, Gen. Sleigh went to Canterbury; had
all the officers of the regiment brought before him, and, without
any investigation, read to them a letter from Headquarters,
condemning Capt. Reynolds&rsquo;s conduct in very strong
language; approving of that of Lord Cardigan, throughout, in
every particular, stigmatizing Capt. Reynolds&rsquo;s motives as
pernicious and vindictive, and refusing a court-martial, because
many things would be brought to light which would not be for the
good of the Service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capt. Reynolds then requested that he might be brought
to a court-martial for the offences for which he had now been
charged.&nbsp; This was also refused, as it was stated Lord Hill
had determined it should be considered as settled.&nbsp; And, as
if this was not enough, Gen. Sleigh told Capt. Reynolds that he
had forfeited the sympathy of every officer of rank in the
Service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capt. Reynolds applied for copies of all letters
referred to in this statement, which are not given at length, and
was refused them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He still kept in the regiment, which, perhaps, was unwise on
his part, as the sequel shows.&nbsp; Early in September, an
evening party was given by the Earl of Cardigan, to which, <!--
page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>as usual, several officers of the regiment were
invited.&nbsp; In the course of the evening, a young lady
casually observed, aloud, that she &ldquo;did not see Capt.
Reynolds there.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Earl of Cardigan, who happened
to be near, heard the remark, and replied, &ldquo;Oh, no; he is
not one of my visitors.&rdquo;&nbsp; The words were uttered
without any marked expression, and did not, at the time, attract
particular attention.&nbsp; They were, however, carried to Capt.
Reynolds, who, conceiving that the expression was calculated to
affect him as a gentleman, wrote a letter to the Earl of
Cardigan, to know if the expression had been used, and in what
sense.&nbsp; This letter remained unanswered, and the consequence
was, that Capt. Reynolds, stung with this apparently further
slight, was induced to send a second and a stronger letter,
couched in terms which could bear no other interpretation than
that of a challenge.</p>
<p>On receiving this letter, the Earl of Cardigan consulted with
his friends; and, after fairly considering the matter, it was
determined to submit the letters with the whole of the
circumstances connected with the case, to the consideration of
the Colonel of the regiment, Prince Albert.&nbsp; The Prince, on
receiving the papers, laid them before the Commander-in-Chief,
Lord Hill, for his opinion thereon, when it was resolved, by the
latter, to let the matter come fairly before the public, in the
shape of a court-martial, which was, shortly afterwards, held at
Brighton.&nbsp; This court confined itself chiefly to the
consideration of the second letter written by Capt. Reynolds,
which they conceived to be couched in a spirit so insubordinate,
ungentlemanly, and insolent, as to afford the writer no sort of
excuse, or palliation for his conduct, on the alleged grounds of
previous provocation on the part of his commanding officer, and
they adjudged that Capt. Reynolds should be cashiered (Oct.
20).</p>
<p>It certainly was not from a wish not to fight a duel that Lord
Cardigan thus acted with regard to Capt. Reynolds (and no one who
remembers his heading the charge of the Light Brigade at
Balaclava, can question his courage), for he challenged and
fought with Lieut. Tuckett, on 12th Sep.; a duel which was thus
reported in the papers:</p>
<p><!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>In consequence of the Earl of Cardigan having
ascertained that certain letters published recently in the
<i>Morning Chronicle</i>, reflecting, as his lordship supposed,
on his character as an officer and a gentleman, were written by
Lieut. Tuckett, late of the same regiment (11th Hussars), the
noble lord sent him, through Captain Douglas, of the 11th, a
challenge, which was at once accepted, and Capt. Wainwright
(half-pay) was the friend selected by Mr. Tuckett to arrange the
preliminaries.&nbsp; An apology was demanded by the noble lord,
to which the reply was, that if he would deny the allegations
contained in the letters referred to, it should be given.&nbsp;
Lord Cardigan declared that certain portions of those letters
were true, but that the greater part were calumnies.&nbsp; On
this, the apology was refused, and a meeting was the
consequence.&nbsp; It took place on the afternoon of the 12th
Sep., on Wimbledon Common.&nbsp; The first shot was ineffectual,
on both sides; but, on the second fire, Mr. Tuckett received his
adversary&rsquo;s ball in the back part of the lower ribs, which
traversed round to the spine.&nbsp; The ball was extracted, and
Mr. Tuckett, after a time, recovered.</p>
<p>Subsequently, warrants were issued, and Lord Cardigan and his
second were brought before the Bench of Surrey Magistrates, at
Wandsworth; and after several examinations, Lord Cardigan was
committed for trial on the charge of &ldquo;Shooting at Capt. H.
Tuckett with a pistol, with intent to murder, or do him some
bodily harm&rdquo;; and his second, for aiding and abetting
him.&nbsp; The charge was laid under &ldquo;An Act to amend the
Laws relating to Offences against the Person&rdquo; (1 Vic., c.
85, s. 3), which makes the offence set forth in the charge, a
felony, punishable, at the discretion of the Court, with
transportation beyond the seas, for the term of his, or her,
natural life, or for any term not less than fifteen years, or to
be imprisoned for any term not exceeding three years.</p>
<p>He was tried in the House of Lords, on 16 Feb., 1841, by his
peers, and the case against him broke down through a
technicality.&nbsp; His counsel, Sir William Follett, pointed out
that the prosecution had failed in proving a material part <!--
page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>of their case, inasmuch as no evidence had been given
that Captain Harvey Garnett Phipps Tuckett was the person alleged
to have been on Wimbledon Common on the 12th September last, and
whose card only bore the name of Captain Harvey Tuckett.&nbsp;
The peers present returned a verdict of &ldquo;Not guilty,&rdquo;
with the exception of the Duke of Cleveland, who added &ldquo;Not
guilty, legally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The use of steam at sea was beginning to assert itself.&nbsp;
It was only two years since, that I had to chronicle the voyages
of the <i>Sirius</i> and the <i>Great Western</i> across the
Atlantic&mdash;now we have the first steamship to India, sailing
on 25 Sep.&nbsp; She was called <i>The India</i>, and was 1,200
tons and nearly 400 horse-power.&nbsp; She sailed for Calcutta,
calling at the Cape of Good Hope, where she was to stop five
days.&nbsp; It was expected that she would complete her voyage,
including stoppages, within 75 days.</p>
<p>On 30 Sep. the foundation stone of the Nelson Column in
Trafalgar Square was laid, without ceremony.&nbsp; It was a large
block of Dartmoor granite, weighing 14 tons; and, on 16 Oct. the
tenders for building the new Royal Exchange were settled.&nbsp;
They varied very considerably, and the contract was given to the
lowest, that of Messrs. Webb, of Clerkenwell, whose tender was
&pound;2,000 under the architect&rsquo;s estimate.</p>
<p>About this time we begin to hear of Mormonism in England; not
that it was absolutely new, for, on 20 July, 1837, Heber C.
Kimball, Orson Hyde, Willard Richards, Joseph Fielding and
others, landed at Liverpool, on the first mission sent out by the
Mormons.&nbsp; Three days after landing they began preaching at
Preston, and met with such remarkable success that, within the
next eight months, at the expiration of which time, Kimball and
Hyde returned to America, they had converted and baptised about
2,000 people.&nbsp; But the sect was uncommon, as we may see from
the following extract from the <i>Leeds Times</i>, copied into
the <i>Times</i> of 31 Oct.:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">A New
Sect</span>.&mdash;One of the most recent developments <!-- page
148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>of
fanaticism is the appearance of a new sect, in different parts of
England, entitled <i>Latter Day Saints</i>.&nbsp; We believe that
it made its first appearance in Hertfordshire and Leicestershire,
from which counties great numbers of its members have lately
emigrated to the United States.&nbsp; The sect has extended to
Lancashire and Yorkshire; and, by the labours of its preachers,
is now travelling northward into Durham and Northumberland.&nbsp;
The <i>Latter Day Saints</i> assume to do many extraordinary
things.&nbsp; Among other accomplishments peculiar to those who
believe in the new doctrines, they are declared to possess the
power of casting out devils, or curing the sick by laying hands
on them, of resisting the operation of the deadliest poisons, of
speaking with new tongues, and of working miracles of various
kinds.&nbsp; They state that no ministers, now on earth, preach
the Gospel, but themselves, and that, only to them have the
supernatural gifts of the Church been vouchsafed.&nbsp; The
Kingdom of God, they say, is only open to those who have been
baptised by immersion.&nbsp; In addition to the Bible, they state
they are in possession of another work, of equal authority,
entitled <i>The Book of Mormon</i>, the original of which was
found engraved on brass plates, in the central land of
America.&nbsp; Finally, they consider this is the last generation
of mankind, and that they have been sent into the world,
expressly to prepare the way for the Son of Man!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Has my reader forgotten <span class="smcap">The Boy
Jones</span>?&nbsp; He turns up again in this chronicle, for, on
Wednesday, the 2nd of December, the inmates of Buckingham Palace
were, shortly after midnight, aroused by an alarm being given
that a stranger had been discovered under the sofa in Her
Majesty&rsquo;s dressing-room, and the officers of the household
were quickly on the alert.&nbsp; It was soon ascertained that the
alarm was not without foundation, and the daring intruder was
immediately secured, and safely handed over to the tender mercies
of the police.&nbsp; The report of the occurrence spread very
rapidly, and created the most lively interest in London, as it
was feared that the consequent alarm might be attended with <!--
page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>the most dangerous effects to the health of the Queen,
who had been confined only eleven days previously.&nbsp; Happily,
neither mother, nor child suffered in any way.</p>
<p>The facts, as far as can be gathered&mdash;the examination
being a private one, conducted by the Privy Council&mdash;seem to
have been as follows: Shortly after midnight, one of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s pages, accompanied by other domestics of the
Royal household, was summoned into Her Majesty&rsquo;s
dressing-room, which adjoined the bed chamber in which Her
Majesty&rsquo;s accouchement had taken place, by Mrs. Lilly, the
nurse, who thought she heard a noise.&nbsp; A strict search was
made; and, under the sofa on which Her Majesty had been sitting,
only about two hours&rsquo; previously, they discovered a dirty,
ill-looking fellow, who was immediately dragged from his hiding
place, and given into custody.&nbsp; The prisoner was searched,
but nothing of a dangerous nature was found upon him, and the
police, at once, recognised their captive as the Edward Jones,
who had, two years previously, entered the palace in such a
mysterious way.&nbsp; He is described as being very short for his
age, seventeen, and of a most repulsive appearance; but he was,
apparently, unconscious of this defect, as he affected an air of
great consequence, and repeatedly requested the police to address
him in a becoming manner; also behaving with the greatest
nonchalance at his examination before the Privy Council, the next
day.</p>
<p>His first version of the matter was this: On Monday night, the
30th of November, he scaled the wall of Buckingham Palace, about
half-way up Constitution Hill; he then proceeded to the Palace,
and gained an entry through one of the windows.&nbsp; He had not,
however, been long there, when he considered it unsafe for him to
stay, as so many people were moving about; and he left by the
same manner as he entered.&nbsp; The next day, Tuesday, about
nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening, he again effected an entrance
by the same means as before.&nbsp; He then went on to state that
he remained in the Palace the whole of Tuesday night, all
Wednesday, and up to one o&rsquo;clock on Thursday morning, when
the inquisitive youth was captured.&nbsp; He was not satisfied
with this dull and prosaic account <!-- page 150--><a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>of his
entry; but, on the following day, he tried to invent something
marvellous, and alleged that he ascended the roof of the Palace,
and got down the chimney; but there were no marks of soot on his
person, and his first story was, doubtless, the correct one.</p>
<p>The greatest mystery attending the affair was, how he could
have found his way to the room adjoining that in which Her
Majesty slept, without being observed.&nbsp; The delinquent
stated that, during the day, he secreted himself under different
beds, and in cupboards, until, at length, he gained an entrance
into the dressing room; he, moreover, alleged that he sat upon
the throne, that he saw the Queen, and heard the Princess Royal
cry, but his story was such a romance, that no reliance could be
placed upon it.&nbsp; He was extremely reticent as to the cause
of his intrusion into the Palace, the only explanation which he
vouchsafed, on being arrested, was, that he wanted to see what
was going on in the Palace, that he might write about it, and, if
discovered, he should be as well off as Oxford, who fared better
in Bedlam, than he, Jones, did out of it.&nbsp; Even the stern
discipline of the treadmill, to which he was promptly consigned,
failed to extract anything more out of him; his only remark, when
interrogated, being that he had got into the scrape, and must do
the best he could.</p>
<p>His father stated that, in his belief, his unfortunate son was
not of sound mind; but the medical evidence went to show that,
though his head was of a most peculiar formation, he was not
insane.&nbsp; The Council, therefore, came to the decision that
it would be better to inflict summary punishment, and he was
committed to the House of Correction for three months, as a rogue
and vagabond.</p>
<p>If he is to be believed, he fared remarkably well whilst in
his royal residence, as he said he helped himself to soup and
other eatables from a room, which he called the
&ldquo;Cook&rsquo;s Kitchen,&rdquo; but no dependence whatever
could be placed on his word.</p>
<p>Prince Albert was taking leave of Her Majesty for the night,
when the miscreant was discovered; and the Prince, <!-- page
151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>hearing a noise proceeding from the adjoining
apartment, opened the door, and ascertained the cause; but it was
not made known to the Queen till the following day, so as to
prevent any undue alarm on her part.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that this event excited the greatest
interest, and engrossed public attention, nothing else being
talked of.&nbsp; The punishment was considered far too light to
deter a repetition of the offence, which opinion was subsequently
justified.&nbsp; Such an occurrence, of course, was considered
fair material for the humourists of the day to exercise their wit
upon, and there are many allusions to it in the <i>Age</i> and
<i>Satirist</i> of the period; but, as their remarks are not
always conceived in the best taste, they are better left in the
obscurity in which they now dwell.&nbsp; Perhaps, however, this
little couplet from the <i>Satirist</i> may be excepted:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now he in chains and in the prison garb
is<br />
Mourning the crime that couples Jones with darbies.&rdquo; <a
name="citation151"></a><a href="#footnote151"
class="citation">[151]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was Jones&rsquo;s extraordinary powers of finding an
entrance into the Palace that caused Samuel Rogers to declare
that he must be a descendant of the illustrious In---i---go.</p>
<p>On the 15 Dec. the remains of the Emperor Napoleon, which had
been removed from St. Helena, were laid, with great pomp, into
the tomb prepared for them at the Invalides, Paris; and, contrary
to all expectation, there was no disturbance on the occasion.</p>

&ldquo;gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first bit of gossip of this year was the tragic death of
Sam Scott, &ldquo;the American diver,&rdquo; who was born at
Philadelphia, and, at an early age, entered the American
navy.&nbsp; His extraordinary courage and prowess as a diver
rendered him very popular, and, after quitting the naval service,
he travelled about the Union exhibiting.&nbsp; He, subsequently,
visited Canada, and made some tremendous leaps from the banks of
the St. Lawrence, and the lakes which intersect that country; but
his <i>chef d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i> was leaping from a precipice
below the Falls of Niagara, where, according to his own
statement, he jumped the amazing distance of 595 feet, into the
water, which he accomplished without injury or inconvenience!</p>
<p>He was performing in England in 1838, and came to London in
the latter part of 1840; and we now hear of him as issuing a
&ldquo;Challenge to the World for 100 Guineas!&nbsp; Monday next,
Jan. 11, 1841, and during the week, Samuel Scott, the American
diver, will run from Godfrey&rsquo;s White Lion, Drury Lane, to
Waterloo Bridge, and leap into the water, forty feet high from
the bridge, and return back within the hour, every day during the
week, between one and two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were
about 8,000 or 10,000 people assembled to see the feat, which was
to be performed from a scaffolding overhanging the river.&nbsp;
Here he swung by a rope noose round his chin, and afterwards,
with his head downwards and one <!-- page 153--><a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>of his feet
in the noose.&nbsp; He then again hung suspended by his chin, but
the noose slipped, and he was hanged in sight of all that huge
crowd.&nbsp; This fatal accident created a great impression at
the time.</p>
<p>I do not know the Evening paper from which the following
&ldquo;small beer&rdquo; chronicle is copied into the
<i>Times</i> of 12 Feb., but it purports to be an
&ldquo;authentic account&rdquo; of an accident to Prince Albert:
&ldquo;It appears that His Royal Highness was walking in the
Royal gardens, in company of Her Majesty, the only attendant
present being the Hon. Miss Murray, one of the Maids of Honour in
waiting upon the Queen.&nbsp; It not being understood by Col.
Bouverie and Lieut. Seymour that His Royal Highness intended to
skate, they were not, as usual, in attendance on the Prince, who
had left the Palace, with Her Majesty, without their
knowledge.&nbsp; After walking for a short time with the Queen,
on the margin of the lake, His Royal Highness put on his skates,
and left Her Majesty, who remained watching the movements of the
Prince from the gardens.&nbsp; He had not been on the ice more
than two or three minutes, when, as he was proceeding at a rapid
rate towards the spot where the Queen was standing, and had
reached between three or four feet of the water&rsquo;s edge, the
ice suddenly broke, and, instantaneously he was immersed, head
over ears, in the water.&nbsp; His Royal Highness immediately
rose to the surface, when Her Majesty, with great presence of
mind, joined her hand to that of the Hon. Miss Murray (telling
her to stand firm, and to betray no fear), and, extending her
right hand to the Prince, dragged him to the shore.&nbsp; Her
Majesty manifested the greatest courage upon the occasion, and
acted with the most intrepid coolness.&nbsp; As soon as the
Prince was safe on dry land, the Queen gave way to the natural
emotions of joy and thankfulness at his providential escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prince then lost no time in proceeding to the
Palace, where a warm bath was immediately prepared, and His Royal
Highness, within an hour afterwards, was sufficiently well to
receive the King of the Belgians, upon His Majesty&rsquo;s
arrival from Claremont.&nbsp; The ice in the centre of the lake
being <!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>nearly a foot in thickness, some
surprise has been created that the accident should have occurred;
but it appears that the keepers appointed to attend on the
numerous and various aquatic birds which are preserved in the
gardens of the palace, had broken the ice along the sides of the
lake to enable them to take the water during the frost.&nbsp;
These portions had again become slightly frozen over, since they
were broken at an early part of the morning.&nbsp; This was
unknown to the Prince, or the Queen, and, hence, the accident
occurred.&nbsp; There was no person present, at the time,
connected with the gardens, to point out his danger to His Royal
Highness.&nbsp; Yesterday morning, the Prince was suffering from
the effects of a slight cold; but, beyond this, His Royal
Highness has sustained no inconvenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 10th Feb. the Princess Royal was christened.</p>
<p>On 19 Feb. the Queen had a monster cheese presented to her,
&ldquo;on which occasion, she was pleased to express her
satisfaction.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was made from the morning&rsquo;s
milking of 737 cows, prepared by the labour of 50 dairy women, at
West Pennard, Somersetshire, and it weighed 11 cwt.&nbsp; It was
octagon in shape, and its upper surface was decorated with the
Royal Arms, surmounted with a wreath of roses, thistles and
shamrocks.&nbsp; Unfortunately, although it had been made over
two years, it was not considered to be fit to eat for another
eighteen months.</p>
<p><i>Ecce iterum</i> the irrepressible <span class="smcap">Boy
Jones</span>!&nbsp; Prison evidently had no terrors for him; for,
no sooner was he liberated from Tothill Fields, on 2 Mar., than
he, almost immediately, set to work to repeat his former
escapades.&nbsp; On the day previous to his liberation, he was
visited by Mr. Hall, a magistrate, who tried to persuade him to
go to sea; but Jones made certain conditions which could not be
acceded to, and he did not go.&nbsp; This gave an opportunity for
the <i>Satirist</i> to come out with the following appropriate
lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The impudent urchin, whom sure the devil
owns,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Government wants to send into the Navy;<br />
Will not go to sea&mdash;and &rsquo;tis cunning of Jones,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, thus, may avoid his relation, Old
Davey.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>He was then delivered into the care of his parents,
with strict injunctions to them to watch his actions; and, for
some days, his conduct was unexceptionable; he frequently
attended a Methodist chapel, and expressed his intention of
joining a teetotal society.&nbsp; But the charms of notoriety
were too strong for him; and, again, he was drawn, as it were by
a magnet, to Buckingham Palace.&nbsp; Indeed, it possessed such
attractions for him, that, when required to pledge himself,
before leaving prison, not to visit the Palace again, he said he
would not promise, as his curiosity was so great.</p>
<p>On 15 March, shortly after 1 a.m., the sergeant of police on
duty at the Palace imagined, as he was going along the Grand
Hall, that he saw someone peeping through the glass door, and
this turned out to be the case; for, on his approach, Jones ran
up against him, and was, of course, immediately secured.&nbsp; In
consequence of his previous visits, two extra policemen had been
appointed, whose duty it was, on alternate nights, to watch all
the staircases and interior of the building, and it was owing to
this arrangement that Master Jones was stopped early in his
career, on this last occasion.</p>
<p>Like most boys, Jones had a keen appreciation of a feast, all
the more enjoyable because irregularly come by; and, when he was
arrested, he was found to have been sitting at his ease in one of
the royal apartments, regaling himself with some cold meat and
potatoes, which he had conveyed upstairs in his
handkerchief.&nbsp; On being questioned how he obtained an
entrance, his reply was, &ldquo;the same way as before&rdquo;;
and he boasted, moreover, that he could, at any time he pleased,
get into the palace; but he was extremely taciturn, and refused
to satisfy curiosity, more particularly on this point.</p>
<p>What he confessed at his examination by the Privy Council is
not known, as the proceedings were in private, reporters being
excluded, and the public were left in possession of only the
above bare facts.&nbsp; He persisted that the only motive for his
intrusion was to hear the conversation at Court, and to write an
account of it; but this plea of simplicity did not save him from
a repetition of his old sentence of three months <!-- page
156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>imprisonment in the House of Correction, with the
uncomfortable addition, this time, of hard labour.&nbsp; Perhaps
the best punishment for this juvenile addition of Paul Pry would
have been that suggested by the <i>Satirist</i>, in the following
paragraph: &ldquo;As the urchin Jones, in a letter to his father,
stated that his reason for entering the Queen&rsquo;s house was
to &lsquo;seek for noose, in order to rite a book,&rsquo; it is a
matter of general regret that, instead of magnifying the affair
into Home Office importance, the young rogue was not accommodated
with a rope&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;&nbsp; His visit, however,
necessitated the appointment of three additional sentries at the
palace.</p>
<p>What became of him afterwards, nobody knows and nobody cares,
but, one thing is certain, he was <i>persuaded</i> to go to sea,
and <i>Punch</i> (born 17 July) devotes a page (vol. i., p. 46)
to &ldquo;The Boy Jones&rsquo;s Log,&rdquo; a portion of which is
as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This mellancholly reflexion threw me into a
poeticle fitte, and though I was werry uneasy in my
<i>stommik</i>, and had nothing to rite on but my <i>chest</i>, I
threw off as follows in a few 2nds, and arterards sung it to the

</blockquote>
<p>To follow Chronology compels me to turn suddenly from gay to
grave topics.&nbsp; In September, 1833, Newman commenced the
<i>Tracts for the Times</i>, which, according to its
advertisement, had the object of &ldquo;contributing something
towards the practical revival of doctrines (such as the Apostolic
Succession, and the Holy Catholic Church) which, although held by
the great divines of our Church, have become practically obsolete
with the majority of her members.&rdquo;&nbsp; Keble and others
joined him at once, as did Pusey as soon as the state of his
health permitted, together with nearly all the advanced thinkers
at Oxford.&nbsp; These Tracts, issued from time to time, caused a
mighty upheaval in the Church of England, which was known as the
&ldquo;Tractarian movement,&rdquo; the effects of which have
lasted to this day, as may be witnessed in the vast extension of
Church building, the larger attendance and more devout behaviour
of congregations, the brighter and more ornate services, which
are so great a contrast to the general sleepiness both of pastor
and flock which then existed.</p>
<p>Some of these Tracts went farther than people were, as yet,
able to follow, they were &ldquo;strong meat for babes,&rdquo;
and the publication of Tract XC., by Newman, on the Thirty-nine
Articles, brought things to a climax, and on 15 March, the
Vice-Chancellor and the Heads of Houses met to censure the
publication; they came to the resolution: &ldquo;That modes of
interpretation, such as are suggested in the said Tract, evading
rather than explaining the sense of the Thirty-nine Articles, and
reconciling subscription to them, with the adoption of errors
which they were designed to counteract, defeat the object, and
are inconsistent with the due observance of <!-- page 158--><a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>the
Statutes of the University.&rdquo;&nbsp; They only expressed
their opinion which was all they could do, but Newman avowed the
authorship of the Tract, and whilst he was still unconvinced of
his error, he wrote, &ldquo;I am sincerely sorry for the trouble
and anxiety I have given to the members of the Board, and I beg
to return my thanks to them, for an act which, even though
founded on misapprehension, may be made as profitable to myself,
as it is religiously and charitably intended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, neither the writers of the Tracts, nor their
readers, had any intention of severing themselves from the Church
of England, their sole endeavours were to wake it from the torpor
into which it had fallen; and, had there been any tolerance on
the other side, such men as Newman, Manning, and others, would
have been kept to the Church, for they merely enunciated doctrine
and practices which are now almost universal.</p>
<p>The old flint-lock Brown Bess was still in use in the Army,
although percussion arms were introduced in 1840; but we read (13
Ap.) that &ldquo;the exchange of flint for percussion cap guns to
the Army, will cost, this year, &pound;130,000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That amiable gentleman, the Earl of Cardigan, was still making
himself notorious.&nbsp; This time it was flogging a soldier on
Easter Sunday, after Church; and the very first question asked in
the House of Commons, when it met after the Easter recess, was by
Mr. Hume, relating to it.&nbsp; Mr. Macauly replied that:
&ldquo;Whatever other imputations there might be cast on Lord
Cardigan, a disposition for the infliction of corporal punishment
was not one which could justly be thrown on him.&nbsp; From
inquiries which he had made, he had found that, since 1839, up to
the recent case, there was not an instance of the infliction of
corporal punishment in this regiment.&nbsp; The charge, however,
for which he was justly liable to public censure, was the
immediate infliction of punishment, on a Sunday, after Divine
Service.&nbsp; Such a proceeding was clearly contrary to the
religious feelings and habits of the people of this country, and
could not be reconciled with either good sense, or good
feeling.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord Hill, the Commander-in-Chief, only
felt &ldquo;surprised&rdquo; at Lord Cardigan&rsquo;s conduct;
but the <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span><i>Times</i> of 24 Apl. had a most
scathing leading article on the subject, winding up with
&ldquo;we trust some independent member of the House of Commons
will take an early opportunity of cutting the Gordian knot, and
move an address to the Crown for the removal of the Earl of
Cardigan from the Lieut.-Colonelcy of the 11th Hussars.&rdquo; <a

<p>The Electric Telegraph being now a <i>fait accompli</i>, the
honour of the discovery was disputed between Cooke and
Wheatstone&mdash;both claiming it.&nbsp; It was settled by
arbitration, the referees being Marc Isimbard Brunel, the eminent
civil engineer, and Professor Daniell, the inventor of the
Galvanic battery which bears his name, and their Solomonian
judgment was as follows: &ldquo;While Mr. Cooke is entitled to
stand alone, as the gentleman to whom this country is indebted
for having practically introduced and carried out the Electric
Telegraph as a useful undertaking, promising to be a work of
national importance; and Professor Wheatstone is acknowledged as
the scientific man, whose profound and scientific researches had,
already, prepared the public to receive it as a project capable
of practical application; it is to the united labours of two
gentlemen so well qualified for mutual assistance, that we must
attribute the rapid progress which this important invention has
made during the five years since they have been
associated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 24 May was sold by auction an undoubtedly authentic
signature of Shakspere, attached to a deed, thus described in the
catalogue: &ldquo;Shakspere&rsquo;s autograph affixed to a deed
of bargain and sale of a house purchased by him, in Blackfriars,
from Henry Walker, dated March 10, 1612, with the seals
attached.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poet is described as &ldquo;Wm.
Shakspeare, of Stratforde upon Avon, in the countie of Warwick,
gentleman&rdquo;; and the premises thus: &ldquo;All that dwelling
house, or tenement, with the appurtenance, situate and being
within the precinct, circuit and compasse of the late black
ffryers, London, sometymes in the tenure of James Gardiner,
Esqre., and <!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>since that time, in the tenure of
John Ffortescue, gent, and now, or late being in the tenure or
occupacon of one William Ireland, or of his assignee or
assignees; abutting upon a streete leading down to Pudle Wharffe
on the east part, right against the King&rsquo;s Majesties
Wardrobe; part of wch said tenement is erected over a great gate
leading to a capitall messuage, wch sometyme was in the tenure or
occupacon of the Right Honourable Henry now Earle of
Northumberland.&rdquo;&nbsp; The deed, at the commencement is
stated to be &ldquo;betweene Henry Walker, Citizen and Minstrell,
of London, of thone partie, and William Shakspeare, of Stratforde
upon Avon, in the countie of Warwick, gentleman; William Johnson,
Citizen and Vintner, of London; John Jackson and John Hemyng, of
London, of thother partie&rdquo;; and that the property was
absolutely sold to all four, &ldquo;theire heires and assigns for
ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; The deed is regularly entered in the
Rolls&rsquo; Court Sir F. Madden (continues the catalogue) states
in his &ldquo;Observations on the autograph of Shakspere,&rdquo;
in Florio&rsquo;s translation of <i>Montaigne&rsquo;s Essays</i>,
which was sold in 1838: &ldquo;There are five acknowledged
genuine signatures in existence, exclusive of the one which forms
the subject of this communication.&nbsp; Of these, three are
attached to his will in the Prerogative Court, executed the 25th
March, 1615&ndash;16; the fourth is written on a mortgage deed,
dated 11 March, 1612&ndash;13; of a small estate purchased by
Shakspere, of Henry Walker, in Blackfriars; and the fifth, on the
counterpart of the deed of bargain and sale of the said property,
dated 10 March, 1612&ndash;13; and, speaking of the last, Sir F.
Madden says, at p. 14: &lsquo;What has become of this
document?&rsquo; a query which the auctioneers say is
answered.&nbsp; Of these six signatures, three to the will are in
Doctors&rsquo; Commons (two of them much injured by the hands of
the lovers of Shakspere); the one in <i>Montaigne&rsquo;s
Essays</i> is now in the British Museum; what has become of the
mortgage deed is quite unknown: this, then, is the only autograph
of Shakspere ever likely to be offered for sale.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After many and very animated biddings it was eventually knocked
down to Mr. Elkins for &pound;165 15s.&nbsp; These two deeds are
now in safe keeping, one being in the <!-- page 161--><a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>British
Museum, the other belonging to the Corporation of the City of
London.&nbsp; The authenticity of the signature in
<i>Montaigne&rsquo;s Essays</i> is open to discussion.&nbsp; At
the same sale was sold &ldquo;the Shakspere Cup,&rdquo; made from
the mulberry tree said to have been planted by Shakspere, carved
on the sides with a medallion of Shakspere, and his Coat of
Arms.&nbsp; This was for nearly 30 years in the possession of
Munden, the actor, and it realised &pound;21.&nbsp; In the
British Museum is a beautifully-carved casket, made of the same
wood, which, together with the freedom of Stratford-on-Avon, was
given to Garrick by the Corporation of the town in 1769.</p>
<p>The decennial Census, which began in 1801, was, according to
the Act 3 and 4 Vic., c. 29, taken of the number of individuals
who slept in the respective houses in each parish, throughout
England and Wales, on the night of Sunday, 6 June.&nbsp;
Scotland, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man were also
taken, but Ireland was not; and the following return includes
only such part of the Army, Navy, and Merchant Seamen, as were,
at the time of the Census, within the Kingdom on shore:</p>

<p>On 8 June, Astley&rsquo;s Amphitheatre was burnt down, one
life being sacrificed, and causing a monetary loss of over
&pound;30,000.&nbsp; This calamity so affected the proprietor,
Mr. Ducrow, that he lost his reason, and died soon after, on 28
Jan., 1842.</p>
<p>Here is another little story of the behaviour of gentlemen in
those days, copied from the <i>Times</i>, 11 June:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Windsor</span>, 10 June.&nbsp; Yesterday evening
there was a large party consisting of the officers of the 60th
Rifles, and several of the 1st Life Guards, at the mess of the
infantry barracks, in Sheet Street, in consequence of several
promotions which have recently taken place in the Rifles,
occasioned by vacancies caused by the decease of the Hon. Col.
Molyneux.&nbsp; The festivities of the evening were kept up till
past 12 o&rsquo;clock, when a large party sallied forth for
&lsquo;a spree.&rsquo;&nbsp; They first proceeded to the
extensive canvas amphitheatre of Mr. Van Amburgh, in the
Bachelor&rsquo;s Acre, but, there, they were, fortunately, kept
at bay by several of Mr. Van Amburgh&rsquo;s men, before they had
committed any excesses.&nbsp; The knockers, bell handles and
brass plates from several doors in the neighbourhood were then
wrenched off, and the whole party then made for a well-known
gambling house (which has been tolerated in this town for upwards
of twelve months), at No. 4, Augusta Place, where they were
immediately admitted.&nbsp; What took place there before the row
commenced, or what was the occasion of the havoc and destruction
which almost immediately afterwards ensued, I have not been able
to ascertain.&nbsp; However, they had not been there more than
half an hour before there was a scene of the greatest confusion
throughout the whole house, causing alarm and terror, from the
noise which was created, around the entire neighbourhood.&nbsp;
The police were sent for soon after 1 o&rsquo;clock, previously
to which a portion of the 60th Rifles, who were on guard at the
Castle, had been despatched to the scene of action, and whom the
police met on their return to the guard room.&nbsp; Upon the
Superintendent, Sergeant and several policemen entering the house
(which they found empty, with the exception of one of the
gamblers, who, it appeared, had secreted himself) they found
scarcely one piece of furniture left whole.&nbsp; The green baize
was torn from the billiard and other tables, the doors of the
different rooms broken down, the windows, with the sashes and
frames, broken to pieces; all the lamps smashed, chairs and
tables dislocated, the fanlight over the front door gone, and the
balustrades upon the stairs torn away.&nbsp; At this time, the
whole of the party had <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>gone off;
and, as for the proprietors of the gaming house, they were glad
to effect their escape, across the garden, into a large piece of
waste land, called the Lammas.&nbsp; It was expected that some
complaint would have been lodged before the borough magistrates,
to-day, at the Town Hall; but no application was made to the
Bench on the subject during the hours of business.&nbsp; A large
brass plate, which had been wrenched from a garden gate, was
found, this morning, by the police, in the infantry barracks,
where there are sundry knockers and bell handles awaiting to be
identified and returned to their respective owners.&rdquo; <a

<p>The following incident is very little known, and is copied
from the <i>Salopian Journal</i> of 3 July: &ldquo;It is known to
many of our readers that the Whig-Radical faction in Shrewsbury,
despairing (as the event has proved) of winning the election by
fair and honest means, have resorted to the infamous trick of
publishing anonymous slanders against Mr. Disraeli, one of the
Tory Candidates.&nbsp; He rebutted the slanders so promptly and
effectually, that, at last, the opposite party resolved to try
the desperate expedient of publishing them with a name attached,
as a sort of guarantee.&nbsp; Accordingly, a letter, repeating
these slanders, &ldquo;with additions,&rdquo; appeared in the
<i>Shrewsbury Chronicle</i> on Friday, signed by a barrister, who
had been employed by the Radical candidates to manage their part
of the contest.&nbsp; Mr. Disraeli, without any loss of time,
issued a handbill commenting on conduct which appears to us at
once ungentlemanly and unprofessional, and plainly designated the
barrister&rsquo;s statements as &lsquo;utterly
false.&rsquo;&nbsp; This handbill appeared early in the forenoon
of Friday, and, at an advanced hour of the afternoon, a gentleman
waited upon Mr. Disraeli with a hostile message from his
calumniator.&nbsp; He found Mr. Disraeli in company with his
lady, and communicated that he had business of <!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>importance
to settle with him.&nbsp; A challenge from the barrister was then
handed to Mr. Disraeli.&nbsp; About an hour afterwards, Mr.
Jonathan Sheppard having learnt that such a transaction had taken
place&mdash;and it is certain that the information had not come
from the challenged party&mdash;waited upon the Mayor, and, upon
his information, our worthy Chief Magistrate called upon both
parties to enter into recognizances to keep the peace.&nbsp; How
far Mr. Disraeli would have been justified in meeting a person
who had acted as the barrister had acted, is a question which
need not be discussed here.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Story of an Irish informer&mdash;Steam
Cars&mdash;Sale of Vauxhall Gardens&mdash;First Jewish
Baronet&mdash;New Railways opened&mdash;High tide&mdash;Fire at
the Tower&mdash;Birth of Prince of Wales&mdash;His patent as
such&mdash;The Thames at length tunnelled&mdash;Antiquities found
in Royal Exchange.</p>
<p>We have known something about Irish crime, but the following
true tale takes a lot of beating.&nbsp; On the last day of the
Clonmel Assizes, in July, Judge Torrens heard a case of arson, in
which the prisoners, who were four in number, were all acquitted,
after a trial which lasted eight hours.</p>
<p>The principal witness for the prosecution was an approver,
named Lysaght; and, in all the annals of informers, it would be
extremely difficult to find a parallel to this same
Lysaght.&nbsp; Indeed, the admission by the Crown of the
testimony of such a miscreant, in the matter of life or death,
appears to be highly reprehensible, as the following abstract of
his evidence will plainly evince:</p>
<blockquote><p>John Lysaght examined: I remember the time when
Walsh&rsquo;s house was burnt.&nbsp; Anthony Ryan came to me
before the house was burned to borrow a gun.&nbsp; I brought it
to him on a Monday night, and he told me to come with him to
McCarthy&rsquo;s house, who wanted to see me.&nbsp; I went to
McCarthy&rsquo;s, and near his place was an old house, in which
some of our party were assembled.&nbsp; McCarthy brought some
bread and spirits, and we took share of it.&nbsp; McCarthy asked
me if I would go with the men to frighten Walsh, and burn the
house.&nbsp; I promised to do so, and he then furnished us with
powder and ball; we went down to the river side, and McCarthy
gave his pistols and 7/6 in money to Anthony <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>Ryan.&nbsp;
He gave me some powder, flax, and something like saltpetre, and
showed me, by putting some powder into the pan, and snapping it,
how the flax was to be lighted.&nbsp; McCarthy then parted with
us, and we, after eating the bread and meat, went to
Walsh&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I lighted the tow, and Paddy Ryan put the
fire into the roof.&nbsp; I and two of the party then went and
stood sentry near the road.&nbsp; After a time, I heard a noise,
and ran back to give an alarm.&nbsp; We then left, and went by
Toom homewards, and separated near Marshall&rsquo;s gate; this
was about three or four in the morning.&nbsp; I and Paddy Ryan
had shot guns, Ned Ryan had a long one, Darby Ryan a bayonet on a
pole, and the two Ryans had McCarthy&rsquo;s pistols.&nbsp; We
left the house after it was in flames.&nbsp; I knew a man named
Bryan Noonan; he is dead.</p>
<p>Judge Torrens: Was it you murdered Noonan?</p>
<p>Witness: No.&nbsp; I joined in it.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell: How many men did you murder before this?</p>
<p>Witness: None.</p>
<p>You say it was Anthony Ryan went to you to get the
gun?&mdash;It was.</p>
<p>He has, since, been transported?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>You went with the party to the burning for the love of
amusement?&mdash;They induced me to go with them, but did not
force me; I was not very unwilling to go after getting the
liquor; but, when I brought the gun, had no such intention.</p>
<p>Did you load the gun before you went out?&mdash;I did.</p>
<p>Had you liberty to carry a gun?&mdash;Yes, from a magistrate,
Mr. Coates, who is since dead.</p>
<p>Were you ever tried before you committed the murder on
Noonan?&mdash;Indeed I was; I was tried before, for posting a
threatening notice, but it was no such thing.</p>
<p>Were you not sentenced to be transported?&mdash;I was.</p>
<p>Did you not fire shots at the same time?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Judge Torrens: And the reward you gave the Government for
bringing you back was murdering Noonan</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell: Was not your brother Caravat
tried?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>You say you were only present at the murder of Noonan; now,
was it not you who knocked down the unfortunate man <!-- page
167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>with the butt-end of a blunderbuss?&mdash;Yes, the very
first.&nbsp; (Sensation.)</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t call that murdering the man?&mdash;We were
all murdering him.</p>
<p>Were you not one of the men who carried him into the ditch to
hide the body?&mdash;I was.</p>
<p>Where is your brother, the Caravat?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
know.</p>
<p>Was he at the burning of Walsh&rsquo;s house?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>Did you know Leonard, the smith?&mdash;I did.</p>
<p>Did you see him killed?&mdash;I saw him struck, but was not
looking on at his killing.</p>
<p>Did you give him a blow then?&mdash;I did not strike a blow at
the man.</p>
<p>Did you give a blow that day?&mdash;Yes, when myself was
struck.</p>
<p>Do you remember Wat Hayes?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>You attacked him, but he shot you off?&mdash;No, he did
not.</p>
<p>Was not one of your companions shot by Mr. Hayes?&mdash;No,
but a man near me.</p>
<p>Now, tell me, did he not kill one of your friends?&mdash;Oh,
he had a party against us, and waylaid us.</p>
<p>Did you remember Jemmy Hughes, who was killed with a
hatchet?&mdash;I did.</p>
<p>Were you not looking at his murder?&mdash;Oh, no; he was
married to my first cousin.</p>
<p>Were you not taxed with the murder?&mdash;The whole country
knew who was in that affair.</p>
<p>You recollect David Hickey, who was killed at Bilboa?&mdash;I
was in the fair.</p>
<p>You were of the party?&mdash;I was looking at him.</p>
<p>That was your third murder.</p>
<p>A Juror: His fifth murder.</p>
<p>Did you rob Michael Rogers?&mdash;No, but I got the course of
law, and was acquitted.</p>
<p>You knew Mick Griffin, Lord Stradbroke&rsquo;s herd?&mdash;I
heard he was shot.</p>
<p>Was your brother Caravat accused of this business?&mdash;No, I
never heard of it.</p>
<p><!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>Did you not say you would put a rope about
McCarthy&rsquo;s neck?&mdash;I did not.&nbsp; I remember when
Kennedy was put out of possession.&nbsp; McCarthy&rsquo;s cattle
and premises were burned after this, but the country say it was
himself did it.&nbsp; I never asked a farm of Lord Stradbroke,
but my father or brothers might.&nbsp; I never heard that
McCarthy prevented us getting the farm, on the ground of our
being so bad.</p>
<p>Do you remember you and your uncle carrying away a
woman?&mdash;I do.</p>
<p>Your uncle was transported?&mdash;He was.</p>
<p>So you have been guilty of one abduction, five murders, and
one burning; what else did you do?&nbsp; Would you suggest any
other crime in the catalogue, of which you were not guilty?</p>
<p>Judge Torrens: Did you commit a rape?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell: Were any of your brothers convicted of a
rape?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Were you not charged with holding the unfortunate woman while
your brother committed the rape?&mdash;No, but another brother
was.</p>
<p>Judge Torrens: Did you steal cattle?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell: That would be too shabby an offence.&nbsp; When
you came to Walsh&rsquo;s house, you lifted one of the Ryans up
in the roof?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>And you lit the fire?&mdash;I did.</p>
<p>Did you know there were women in the house?&mdash;I partly
guessed there were.</p>
<p>Did you mind how many innocent people might have been
burned?&mdash;I did not care.&nbsp; (Great sensation.)</p>
<p>Judge and Counsel, with great disgust, ordered the wretch off
the table.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these days of Motor Cars, any gossip about their
progenitors must be of interest.&nbsp; On 7 Aug., a steam
carriage, carrying 16 persons, belonging to the General Steam
Company, was tried between the York and Albany, Regent&rsquo;s
Park, and the Manor House at Tottenham&mdash;i.e., along the
Camden Road to Finsbury Park&mdash;doing the distance in rather
<!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>less than half-an-hour.&nbsp; Another ran on 13 Sep.
from Deptford to Sevenoaks, about 21 miles, in 2 hours 37
minutes, but there were small accidents by the way.&nbsp; Later
on in the month the first-named carriage performed about Windsor,
Frogmore and Dachet, and frequently reached a speed of 18 to 20
miles an hour; and on Oct. 1 it was shown to the Queen and Prince
Albert, the latter expressing himself highly pleased with
it.&nbsp; It then only did 16 miles an hour.</p>
<p>On 9 Sep. Vauxhall Gardens, which had been a place of
amusement since the time of Charles I., were sold for
&pound;20,000.&nbsp; In <i>Punch</i> of 14 Aug. we find a sad
account of a last visit:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Impelled by a sense of duty, we wended our
way to the &lsquo;Royal property,&rsquo; <a
name="citation169a"></a><a href="#footnote169a"
class="citation">[169a]</a> to take a last look at the long
expiring gardens.&nbsp; It was a wet night&mdash;the lamps burnt
dimly&mdash;the military band played in the minor key&mdash;the
waiters stalked about with so silent, melancholy a tread, that we
took their towels for pocket handkerchiefs; the concert in the
open <i>rain</i> went off tamely&mdash;dirge-like, in spite of
the &lsquo;Siege of Acre,&rsquo; which was described in a set of
quadrilles, embellished with blue fire and maroons, and adorned
with a dozen double drums, thumped at intervals, like death
notes, in various parts of the doomed gardens.&nbsp; The
<i>divertissement</i> was anything but diverting, when we
reflected upon the impending fate of the &lsquo;Rotunda,&rsquo;
in which it was performed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such damp was, however, thrown over the evolutions
of &lsquo;Ducrow&rsquo;s beautiful horses and equestrian
<i>artistes</i>,&rsquo; including the &lsquo;new grand
<i>entr&eacute;e</i> and calvacade of Amazons.&rsquo;&nbsp; They
had no sympathy with the decline and fall of the
<i>Simpsonian</i> <a name="citation169b"></a><a
href="#footnote169b" class="citation">[169b]</a> empire.&nbsp;
They were strangers, interlopers, called in, like mutes and
feathers, to grace the &lsquo;funeral show,&rsquo; to give a more
graceful flourish to the final exit.&nbsp; The horses pawed the
sawdust, evidently unconscious that the earth it covered would
soon be &lsquo;let on lease for building ground&rsquo;; the
riders seemed in the hey-day of their equestrian triumph.&nbsp;
Let them, however, <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>derive from the fate of Vauxhall a
deep, a fearful lesson!&mdash;though we shudder as we write, it
shall not be said that destruction came upon them
unawares&mdash;that no warning voice had been raised&mdash;that
even the squeak of <i>Punch</i> was silent!&nbsp; Let them not
sneer, and call us superstitious&mdash;we do <i>not</i> give
credence to supernatural agency as a fixed and general principle;
but we did believe in Simpson, and stake our professional
reputation upon Widdicomb! <a name="citation170a"></a><a
href="#footnote170a" class="citation">[170a]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;That Vauxhall Gardens were under the special protection
of, that they drew the very breath of their attractiveness from,
the ceremonial Simpson, who can deny?&nbsp; When he flitted from
walk to walk, from box to box, and welcomed everybody to the
&lsquo;Royal property,&rsquo; right royally did things go
on!&nbsp; Who would <i>then</i> have dreamt that the illustrious
George <a name="citation170b"></a><a href="#footnote170b"
class="citation">[170b]</a>&mdash;he of the Piazza&mdash;would
ever be &lsquo;honoured with instructions to sell&rsquo;? that
his eulogistic pen would be employed in giving the puff
superlative to the Elysian haunts of quondam fashion&mdash;in
other words&mdash;painting the lily-gilding refined gold?&nbsp;
But, alas!&nbsp; Simpson, the tutelar deity, departed
(&lsquo;died,&rsquo; some say, but we don&rsquo;t believe it),
and, at the moment he made his last bow, Vauxhall ought to have
been closed; it was madness&mdash;the madness which will call us,
peradventure, superstitious&mdash;which kept the gates open when
Simpson&rsquo;s career closed&mdash;it was an anomaly, for, like
Love and Heaven, Simpson was Vauxhall, and Vauxhall was
Simpson!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Ducrow reflect upon these things&mdash;we dare not
speak out&mdash;but a tutelar being watches over, and giveth
vitality to his arena&mdash;his ring is, he may rely upon it, a
fairy one&mdash;while <i>that</i> mysterious being dances and
prances in it, all will go well; his horses will not stumble,
never will his clowns forget a syllable of their antiquated
jokes.&nbsp; Oh! let him, then, whilst seriously reflecting upon
Simpson and the fate of Vauxhall, give good heed unto the
Methuselah, who hath already passed his second centenary in the
circle!</p>
<p>&ldquo;These were our awful reflections while viewing the <!--
page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>scenes in the circle, very properly constructed in the
Rotunda.&nbsp; They overpowered us&mdash;we dared not stay to see
the fireworks, &lsquo;in the midst of which Signora Rossini was
to make her terrific ascent and descent on a rope three hundred
feet high.&rsquo;&nbsp; She <i>might</i> have been the sprite of
Madame Saqui; <a name="citation171"></a><a href="#footnote171"
class="citation">[171]</a> in fact, the &lsquo;Vauxhall
Papers,&rsquo; published in the gardens, put forth a legend which
favours such a dreadful supposition.&nbsp; We refer our readers
to them&mdash;they are only sixpence apiece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, the gardens were full, in spite of the
weather; for what must be the callousness of that man who could
let <i>the</i> Gardens pass under the hammer of George Robins,
without bidding them an affectionate farewell?&nbsp; Good
gracious! we can hardly believe such insensibility does
exist.&nbsp; Hasten then, dear readers, as you would fly to catch
the expiring sigh of a fine old boon companion&mdash;hasten to
take your parting slice of ham, your last bowl of
arrack&mdash;even now, while the great auctioneer says
&lsquo;going.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>On 24 August Sir J. L. Goldsmid was made a Baronet, and was
the first Jewish gentleman who ever received that title.&nbsp;
Perhaps it is not generally known that an honour, not much
inferior, had, once, very nearly fallen to the lot of a brother
Israelite.&nbsp; At one of those festive meetings at Carlton
House, in which George IV. sometimes allowed a few of his most
favoured subjects to participate, Mr. Braham was introduced to
sing his then newly-composed song, &ldquo;A Bumper of
Burgundy,&rdquo; when the gratified monarch, rising from his
chair, was, with difficulty, restrained from conferring immediate
knighthood on the flattered musician.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Three well-known railways were opened this year; the Great
Western, from London to Bristol, on 30 June; the London and
Blackwall, on 2 Aug.; and the London and Brighton, on 21 Sep.</p>
<p>On 18 Oct. was a remarkably high tide in the Thames, which did
an immense amount of damage.&nbsp; This, and another event were
celebrated in a contemporary ballad, beginning:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s lately been a
great high tide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor can it be surprising,<br />
When everything is getting dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That water should be rising,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and after dealing with that event in a very witty manner, it
went on:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Tower of London, envying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Father Thames&rsquo;s notoriety,<br />
Resolved to have a &lsquo;flare up&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And be talked of in society;<br />
Ten thousand guns were fired at once,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With very few escapers,<br />
But, though no one heard the great report,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There was one in the papers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This terrible conflagration was first noticed about half-past
ten, on the night of 31 Oct., by a sentinel on duty on the
terrace near the Jewel Office, whose attention was attracted to a
glimmering light under the cupola of the Round, or Bowyer
Tower&mdash;which was close to the Armoury, in which was
deposited an immense amount of stores, such as muskets, etc., and
many priceless trophies of war.&nbsp; When the sentinel found the
light increased, he gave the alarm by firing his musket, and the
whole of the garrison, officers and men, turned out; but the fire
had got so great a hold that, before a sufficient supply of water
could be obtained, the entire roof of the Armoury was in
flames.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was low tide in the Thames, and, although
the fire-engines soon arrived, and there were the Garrison and
250 policemen to render assistance, the flames spread rapidly; so
fast, indeed, that the only things then got out and saved, were
the Duke of York&rsquo;s sword and belt, and a beautiful Maltese
gun.</p>
<p>The grand staircase of this Armoury was considered one of the
finest in Europe, and the following is a contemporary description
of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;In a recess on the landing was a platform
supported on eight brass six-pounder guns, taken at Waterloo, and
which served as pillars.&nbsp; On this was a splendid trophy,
<!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>consisting of arms and weapons, ancient and modern,
comprising nearly 200 varieties, and nearly all differing in form
or pattern.&nbsp; In the centre was a marble bust of William
IV.&nbsp; Upon the walls, at the sides, were two large stars,
formed of swords, and their brass scabbards, bayonets and
pistols, one representing the Star of the Garter, and the other
of the Bath.&nbsp; Also two figures in gilt suits of armour on
ornamented pedestals.&nbsp; The rails of the stairs and the
cornice of the ceiling were ornamented with architectural
figures, curiously formed with arms.&nbsp; Below, upon pedestals,
were two very striking groups, one representing a knight in gilt
armour, preparing for action, attended by his esquire, who was in
the act of buckling on his spurs, and a pikeman, with his 18 feet
pike.&nbsp; The other group was a knight in a handsome suit of
bright armour, of the time of Elizabeth, in action, having seized
a banner from the enemy, waving his followers on.&nbsp; On each
side of the entrance door was a knight in a suit of gilt armour,
and two others, similarly clad, stood on brackets.&nbsp; The
whole of these were destroyed, with the exception of the Waterloo
cannon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire was soon perilously near to the Jewel Office, which
was scorching hot&mdash;yet Mr. Swifte, the keeper of the jewels,
saved the whole of the Regalia, down to the minutest article, and
was earnestly begged to retire and leave the last thing, a huge
silver wine fountain, to its fate, but he would not, and this,
also, was salved.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Then Mr. Swifte was nothing slow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Crown and Jewels saving;<br />
And to get the great Wine Cooler out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Great danger he was braving.<br />
Now, Mr. Swifte, of all the wine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should now be made the ruler,<br />
For while the fire was getting hotter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He was getting <i>the Wine Cooler</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an awful scare as to the chance of the store of
gunpowder catching alight&mdash;but 400 barrels of powder, and
200 boxes of grenades and ball cartridges, were removed to the
magazine, and the remainder was thrown into the moat.</p>
<p><!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>On the 8th Dec. the general public were allowed to
inspect the ruins, and to purchase mementos of the fire; the
prices were, 6d. for half-a-dozen gun-flints, and the same amount
for a few burnt percussion caps; pieces of fused iron and arms
went at prices varying from 1s. to 20s., the latter, the maximum
price.&nbsp; For many years I had a fused cavalry pistol, and
some calcined flints which were very pretty.&nbsp; The fused
cannon were sold as old metal.</p>
<p>On the 9 Nov. His Majesty Edward VII. was born, and, on the
8th Dec. was created Prince of Wales.&nbsp; His patent is as
follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Victoria, by the grace of God, of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Queen, Defender of
the Faith.</p>

<p>We read in the <i>Times</i> of 25 Nov., anent the Thames
Tunnel, that &ldquo;a thoroughfare was, yesterday, effected in
this work, and made use of, for the first time, by the whole of
the directors, and some of the original subscribers, who had
assembled upon the occasion.&nbsp; The shield having been
advanced to the shaft at Wapping, a considerable opening was cut
in the brickwork, and it was through this the party, who had met
at Rotherhithe, were enabled to pass, thus opening the first
subterranean communication between the opposite shores of the
river.&nbsp; Upon their arrival at the shaft, the party was
greeted by the workmen with most hearty cheers.&nbsp; A curious
and interesting incident was connected with the event; a few
bottles of wine, preserved since the dinner given on the occasion
when the foundation stone was laid, with the understanding that
it was to be drunk only when it could be carried under the
Thames, having been opened and enjoyed by the company, to the
health of Her Majesty and the infant Prince.&nbsp; It was
remarked, too, as a singular coincidence, that a seal on one of
the corks bore the impress of the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s
feathers, a circumstance that caused some merriment.&nbsp; The
engineer, Sir I. Brunel, appeared highly gratified at the happy
result of his past anxiety and arduous labour.&nbsp; The shield
will continue its advance, until it has afforded space for the
formation of the remainder of the tunnel, which is expected to be
completed in about three weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the end of the year the foundations of the New Royal <!--
page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>Exchange were dug out and concreted, and, as it was
always anticipated that some important discoveries might take
place in the course of the excavation, proper arrangements were
made on the commencement of the work, that any articles of
interest which might be disinterred, should be secured for the
Gresham Committee.&nbsp; In the Specification for the Works,
issued in 1840, the Contractor and Excavator were required, in
taking out the soil, to deliver up &ldquo;any plate, coins,
antiquities, or curiosities, whether in metal, or otherwise, or
any carved stones, or carvings in marble, pottery, terra cotta,
or tesser&aelig;, which may be found in the course of the
excavations; it being understood that all such matters, or
things, are to be taken up with all requisite care, and are to
remain the property of the Gresham Committee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found a portion of a Roman building, but the greatest
haul was in an old gravel pit, some 50ft. by 34, filled with
hardened mud, in which were contained considerable quantities of
animal and vegetable remains, apparently the discarded refuse of
the inhabitants of the vicinity.&nbsp; In the same depository
were also found very numerous fragments of the red Roman pottery,
usually called &ldquo;Samian Ware,&rdquo; pieces of glass
vessels, broken terra-cotta lamps, parts of amphor&aelig;,
mortaria, and other articles made of earth, and all the rubbish
which might naturally become accumulated in a pond in the course
of years.&nbsp; In this mass likewise occurred a number of
Imperial Roman coins, several bronze and iron styles, parts of
writing tablets, a bather&rsquo;s strigil, a large quantity of
caliga soles, sandals and remains of leather, all of which can
now be seen in the highly interesting Museum of the Corporation
of the City of London, at the Guildhall.</p>

Earthquake in London&mdash;The Queen drinking

Strawberry Hill&mdash;Presents to the King of Prussia.</p>
<p>The first event of note in this year was the laying, by Prince
Albert, of the foundation stone of the Royal Exchange, on 17
Jan., with all the pomp at the command of the City
authorities.&nbsp; The usual coins, etc., were deposited in a
cavity, together with a Latin inscription, engraved on zinc, of
which the following is a translation: &ldquo;Sir Thomas Gresham,
Knight, erected, at his own charge, a building and colonnade for
the convenience of those persons who, in this renowned Mart,
might carry on the commerce of the World, adding thereto, for the
relief of indigence, and for the advancement of literature and
science, an Almshouse and College of Lecturers, the City of
London aiding him, Queen Elizabeth favouring the design; and,
when the work was complete, opening it in person with a solemn
procession.&nbsp; Having been reduced to ashes with almost the
entire city, by a calamitous and wide spreading conflagration,
they were rebuilt in a more splendid form by the City of London
and the Ancient Company of Mercers, King Charles II. commencing
the building on 23 Oct., A.D. 1667; and, when they had been again
destroyed by fire, on the 10th Jan., AD. 1838, the same Bodies,
undertaking the work, determined to restore them at their own
cost, on an enlarged and more ornamental plan; the munificence of
Parliament providing the means of extending the site, and of
widening the approaches and crooked streets, in every direction;
in order that there might, at length, arise, <!-- page 178--><a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>under the
auspices of Queen Victoria, built a third time from the ground,
an Exchange, worthy of this great Nation and City, and suited to
the vastness of a Commerce extending to the circumference of the
habitable Globe.&nbsp; His Royal Highness of Saxe-Coburg and
Gotha, Consort of Her Sacred Majesty, laid the first stone on 17
Jan., 1842, in the Mayoralty of the Rt. Hon. John Pirie.&nbsp;
Architect, William Tite, F.R.S.&nbsp; May God, our Preserver,
ward off destruction from this building, and from the whole
City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the manner of the City of London, a medal was struck to
commemorate the event, having on the obverse a profile portrait
of Prince Albert, with the legend &ldquo;Albertus ubique
honoratus,&rdquo; the reverse having a view of the western
portico of the Exchange.&nbsp; On 13 Jan. Mr. Roach Smith
exhibited at the Society of Antiquaries a medalet, found on the
site of the Exchange, evidently struck to commemorate Queen
Elizabeth&rsquo;s patronage of the original building, as it bore
the Tudor Arms surrounded with the inscription
&ldquo;Angli&oelig; Regina ubique honorata.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Mathew was still doing his grand work in Ireland, but
there is a story told about him in the <i>Limerick Chronicle</i>,
copied into the <i>Times</i> of 17 Jan., that is too good to be
omitted: &ldquo;The Rev. Mr. Mathew arrived in this city, last
evening, by the Cork mail, <i>en route</i> to Loughrea, and put
up at Moore&rsquo;s hotel.&nbsp; Immediately after his arrival
became known, hundreds of persons visited him at the hotel, where
he administered the pledge.&nbsp; One circumstance which came
within public observation, we may mention here, as illustrative
of the effects of breaking the temperance pledge:&mdash;A man,
named Moynehan, a teetotaller, who worked at the Butter
Weigh-house, got drunk on Christmas Eve, and the next day, became
paralysed, his left arm, side and thigh being perfectly
inanimate.&nbsp; He was removed to Barrington&rsquo;s Hospital,
and remained there under the care of the surgeons, without
improvement, until last evening, when his friends, having heard
of Father Mathew&rsquo;s arrival in town, went to the hospital,
and brought him out of his bed, on a man&rsquo;s back, to where
the Rev. Mr. Mathew was staying; a crowd had collected round <!--
page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>the door, when the unhappy invalid was carried into his
presence, and the reverend gentleman administered to him the
pledge again, in a kind and impressive manner, and the man
instantly stood up, was assisted by his friends to dress; and, to
the astonishment of all, walked up William Street to his home,
followed by a crowd of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 25 Jan., the Prince of Wales was christened in St.
George&rsquo;s Chapel, Windsor, by the name of Albert Edward, and
on 20 Jan. appeared a letter in the <i>Times</i> from &ldquo;A
Conservative&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir.&mdash;We learn from the <i>Times</i>
of to-day, that the Prince will be called Albert Edward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is natural, indeed, that the illustrious father, and
still more, that the illustrious mother, should prefer Albert
Edward to Edward Albert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as I pray God that the boy may live to be King, to
whatever period his mother&rsquo;s life may be graciously
extended, so I trust that he may have every qualification for
popularity as well as goodness, and, amongst others, an old, and
beloved, and accustomed <i>English name</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what so fit as Edward?&nbsp; Who more beloved, or
glorious, than Edward the Confessor&mdash;Edward I.&mdash;Edward
III.&mdash;Edward VI.?&nbsp; A Catholic Saint&mdash;a
law-giver&mdash;a conqueror&mdash;a Protestant Reformer?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Princess Alexandrina Victoria was known by her
second name before she ascended the throne.&nbsp; So, I trust,
may the young Prince be known as Edward, Prince of Wales, to the
people, hereafter, Edward VII.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We all know how this gentleman&rsquo;s aspirations have been
verified.</p>
<p>The King of Prussia was one of the Sponsors, and spent a few
days after the christening in England.&nbsp; Poor man! how they
did make him work!</p>
<p>On the 26th he had to be at the presentation of new colours to
the 72nd Highlanders, and, in the afternoon, he visited Eton
College.</p>
<p><!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>27th.&mdash;Came to London by railway, and held a Court
at Buckingham Palace, where he received the <i>Corps
Diplomatique</i> and the Corporation of the City of London.&nbsp;
On his return to Windsor, he visited Hampton Court.</p>
<p>28th.&mdash;Again came to London, visited the Zoological
Gardens, lunched with Sir Robert Peel, and, afterwards, went to
the Chapel Royal, Whitehall, and the National
Gallery&mdash;dining at Windsor.</p>
<p>29th.&mdash;Saw a review in the Home Park, then went to
London, and dined with his Minister, Chevalier Bunsen, in Carlton
Terrace.</p>
<p>The 30th was Sunday, so the poor man was trotted off to St.
Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral to hear the Bishop of London preach.&nbsp;
Lunched at the Mansion House, visited the King of Hanover&rsquo;s
apartments in St. James&rsquo;s Palace, and Stafford House;
attended afternoon service at the Royal German Chapel, St.
James&rsquo;s; visited the Duchess of Gloucester, in Piccadilly,
and returned to Windsor.</p>
<p>After this rest on the 30th, he visited Newgate Prison, when
he was received by the Lady Mayoress, Mrs. Fry, the Quaker
philanthropist, the Sheriffs, etc., and thence proceeded to lunch
with Mrs. Fry, at Upton, near Barking; at six he went to Drury
Lane Theatre, and saw <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>; dined
with the Duke of Sutherland at Stafford House, and slept at
Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>Next day, 1 Feb., at 10 a.m., he visited the Royal Society,
Society of Antiquaries and the Geological Society.&nbsp; Thence
he went to the British Museum, taking Mr. Solly&rsquo;s
collection of pictures <i>en route</i>; and after spending three
hours at the Museum, he lunched with the Duke of Sussex at
Kensington Palace.&nbsp; In the evening, he underwent a dinner
and concert given by the Duke of Wellington at Apsley House.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the 2nd, he sat to Mr. Hayter for his
portrait in a picture of the Christening.&nbsp; At 8.30 he
embarked at Hungerford Wharf, on a steamer, bound for the Thames
Tunnel; after visiting which, he went to the Tower of
London.&nbsp; At 12 he returned to Buckingham Palace, where he
received addresses from the Bishop and Clergy of the <!-- page
181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>Diocese of London; the members of King&rsquo;s College,
London; the Society for Promoting Christianity among the Jews;
the Prussian subjects resident in London; and the German Lutheran
clergy.&nbsp; He also received deputations from the Bible
Society, the Church Missionary Society, the Imperial Continental
Gas Company; and gave audience to the Prince of Capua, etc.;
visited the Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth; dined with the
Duke of Cambridge; saw the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i> played
at Covent Garden, and afterwards attended an evening, party at
Cambridge House.</p>
<p>On the 3rd he was present at the Queen&rsquo;s Opening of
Parliament, then received a deputation from the general body of
Protestant Dissenters; and visited the Queen Dowager, Earl of
Jersey, the Dowager Duchess of Richmond, the Duke of Cambridge
and the Duke of Wellington; winding up with dining with the
Queen.</p>
<p>On the 4th they let him go&mdash;he paid a visit to the Queen
at 9.30, went to Woolwich and saw a review of Royal Artillery,
lunched there, visited Plumstead Marshes and the Arsenal, took
leave of Prince Albert, and everyone else, and went off to
Ostend.</p>
<p>About this time was a curious craze, which took strange hold
on the people, that London was to be destroyed on the 16th of
March, a belief which seems to have been founded on two metrical
prophecies, dated respectively A.D. 1203 and 1598, said to be in
the British Museum, where, however, I have failed to find them;
the former is:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In eighteen hundred and forty-two<br />
Four things the sun shall view;<br />
London&rsquo;s rich and famous town<br />
Hungry earth shall swallow down;<br />
Storm and rain in France shall be,<br />
Till every river runs a sea;<br />
Spain shall be rent in twain,<br />
And famine waste the land again;<br />
So say I, the Monk of Dree,<br />
In the twelve hundredth year and three.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>The other is fathered on the famous astrologer, Dr.
Dee:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Lord have mercy on you all,<br />
Prepare yourselves for dreadful fall<br />
Of house and land and human soul&mdash;<br />
The measure of your sin is full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the year One, Eight, and Forty-two,<br />
Of the year that is so new,<br />
In the third month, of that sixteen,<br />
It may be a day or two between.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll soon be stiff and cold,<br />
Dear Christian, be not stout and bold;<br />
The mighty Kingly proud will see<br />
This comes to pass, as my name&rsquo;s Dee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And people were found to believe in this
doggerel&mdash;especially frightened were the Irish in London,
and the lower classes generally.&nbsp; There was a great exodus
of the former, some even listening to the entreaties of their
friends, and returning to Ireland, and many of the latter moved
eastward of the church of St. Dunstan&rsquo;s, Stepney, which
they considered would be the last edifice to fall.&nbsp; Nor was
belief in the earthquake confined to the east end of London, for
I read of a man, formerly a police constable, living in
Paddington, St. Marylebone, who sold a good business to provide
the means of his leaving London; and of a clerk, with a salary of
&pound;200 a year, residing in the same parish, resigning his
post, so that he might escape the calamity.</p>
<p>The fateful day arrived and passed, and, of course, the
dreaded event did not take place, but the belief in it is
evidenced in a paragraph in the <i>Times</i> of 17 March:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The
Earthquake</span>.&mdash;The scene witnessed in the
neighbourhoods of St. Giles&rsquo;s and Seven Dials during the
whole of yesterday was, perhaps, the most singular that has
presented itself for many years.&nbsp; Many of the Irish resident
in those localities have left for the shores of the Emerald Isle,
but by far the larger number, unblessed with this world&rsquo;s
goods, have been compelled to remain where they are, and to
anticipate the fearful event which was to engulf them in <!--
page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>the bowels of the earth.&nbsp; The frantic cries, the
incessant appeals to Heaven for deliverance, the invocations to
the Virgin and the Saints for mediation, the heartrending
supplications for assistance, heard on every side during the day,
sufficiently evidenced the power with which this popular delusion
had seized the mind of these superstitious people.&nbsp; Towards
the end of the day, a large number of them determined not to
remain in London during the night, and, with what few things they
possessed, took their departure for what they considered more
favoured spots.&nbsp; Some violent contests arose between the
believers and the sceptics&mdash;contests, which in not a few
cases, were productive of serious results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor Irish, however, are not the only persons who
have been credulous in this matter; many persons from whom better
things might have been expected, were amongst the number who left
London to avoid the threatened catastrophe.&nbsp; To the
Gravesend steamboat companies the &lsquo;earthquake&rsquo; proved
a source of immense gain; and the same may be said with regard to
the different railways.&nbsp; Long before the hour appointed for
the starting of steamboats from London Bridge Wharf, Hungerford
Market, and other places, the shore was thronged by crowds of
decently attired people of both sexes; and, in many instances,
whole families were to be seen with an amount of eatables and
drinkables which would have led one to suppose that they were
going a six-weeks&rsquo; voyage.&nbsp; About 11 o&rsquo;clock,
the <i>Planet</i> came alongside the London Bridge Wharf, and the
rush to get on board of her was tremendous, and, in a few
minutes, there was scarcely standing room on board.&nbsp; The
trains on the various railways were, during the whole of Tuesday
and yesterday morning, unusually busy in conveying passengers
without the proscribed limits of the Metropolitan disaster.&nbsp;
To those who had not the means of taking trips to Gravesend, or
by railway, other places which were supposed to be exempted from
the influence of the &lsquo;rude commotion&rsquo; about to take
place, were resorted to.&nbsp; From an early hour in the morning,
the humbler classes from the east end of the Metropolis sought
refuge in the fields beyond the purlieus of Stepney.&nbsp; On the
north, Hampstead <!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>and Highgate were favoured with a
visit from large bodies of the respectable inhabitants of St.
Giles&rsquo;s; and Primrose Hill, also, was selected as a famous
spot for viewing the demolition of the leviathan city.&nbsp; The
darkness of the day, and the thickness of the atmosphere,
however, prevented it being seen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brighton, too, felt the advantage of the
&ldquo;earthquake,&rdquo; as numbers of families of the middle
and upper classes went there to avoid its consequences.&nbsp; It
was noted that on the night of the 15th nearly 20 carriages
arrived there, a circumstance that had not occurred since the
opening of the London and Brighton Railway.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>To &ldquo;talk scandal about Queen Elizabeth&rdquo; is a
matter serious enough, but to say that Queen Victoria drank grog
on board one of her own ships is rank treason, and must be
explained, as it was by the <i>John Bull</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
true version of Her Majesty&rsquo;s tasting the grog on board of
<i>The Queen</i>, during her late visit to Portsmouth, is as
follows: Strict orders had been given to the men, that when Her
Majesty came down to the lower deck, to see them at mess, they
should not speak a word, but preserve as profound a silence as
possible.&nbsp; Jack, of course, was too much taken up with
watching the Royal visitor, to think of talking, save, perhaps,
the desire of whispering to his messmate a comment or so on the
meteor passing before him.&nbsp; All was still.&nbsp; Her Majesty
tasted the cocoa, and approved of it&mdash;yet all was
still.&nbsp; Her Majesty then inquired whether there was no
stronger beverage allowed the men, and forthwith a tumbler of
&lsquo;three-water grog&rsquo; was handed her.&nbsp; She raised
it to her lips&mdash;when Jack forgot his orders, and three
distinct cheers ran round the deck, with such &lsquo;a
will,&rsquo; that the ship&rsquo;s sides seemed to start with the
sudden explosion; the honour done was more than a sailor could
bear without clearing his heart with an huzzah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was on 8 Feb., 1841, that Fox Talbot provisionally
registered his patent &ldquo;for improvements in obtaining
pictures, or representations of objects,&rdquo; which is now in
vogue, his improvement being the printing of the photo on
paper.&nbsp; He, <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>himself, made no public practical
use of his invention, and one of the first, if not the first
photographer who adopted it was Mr. Beard, of Parliament and King
William Streets.&nbsp; It was quite a new thing when Prince
Albert went to his studio on 21 Mar., 1842, and sat for his
portrait.&nbsp; This made the process fashionable, and henceforth
photography was a practical success.</p>
<p>There is nothing much to gossip about, until the Strawberry
Hill sale.&nbsp; It was all very well for the Earl of Bath to
eulogise the place,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Some cry up Gunnersbury,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Sion some declare,<br />
And some say that with Chiswick House<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No villa can compare;<br />
But, ask the beaux of Middlesex,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who know the country well,<br />
If Strawberry Hill, if Strawberry Hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t bear away the bell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but I fancy no one can endorse the opinion, or see anything to
admire in this heterogeneous pile of Carpenter&rsquo;s and
Churchwarden&rsquo;s Gothic.&nbsp; If it had applied to the
contents that would have been another thing; for, although there
was, as is the case in most large collections, an amount of
rubbish, it was counterbalanced by the undoubted rarity of the
greater portion, which are thus set forth by the perfervid
auctioneer, George Robins, who, speaking of himself in the third
person, says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When there pass before him, in review, the
splendid gallery of paintings, teeming with the finest works of
the greatest masters&mdash;matchless Enamels, of immortal bloom,
by Petitot, Boit, Bordier, and Zincke; Chasings, the work of
Cellini and Jean de Bologna; noble specimens of Faenza Ware, from
the pencils of Robbia and Bernard Palizzi; Glass, of the rarest
hues and tints, executed by Jean Cousin and other masters of the
15th, 16th and 17th centuries; Limoges enamels of the period of
the Renaissance, by Leonard and Courtoise; Roman and Greek
antiquities in bronze and sculpture; <!-- page 186--><a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>Oriental
and European china, of the choicest forms and colours; exquisite
and matchless Missals, painted by Raphael and Julio Clovo;
magnificent specimens of Cinque-Cento Armour; Miniatures,
illustrative of the most interesting periods of history; a
valuable collection of Drawings and Manuscripts; Engravings in
countless numbers, and of infinite value; a costly Library,
extending to fifteen thousand volumes, abounding in splendid
editions of the Classics, illustrated, scarce and unique works,
with ten thousand other relics of the arts and history of bygone
ages, he may well feel overpowered at the evident impossibility
of rendering to each that lengthened notice which their merits
and their value demand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first private view took place on 28 March, and the sale
lasted 24 days, commencing on 25 April and ending 21 May.&nbsp;
No one can hazard a guess as to what such a collection would
fetch now, the sum then obtained, &pound;33,450 11s. 9d., being
utterly inadequate according to modern ideas.&nbsp; The sale took
place in a temporary shed, erected in the grounds, and on the
first day of the sale, which was confined to books, there were
not 200 persons present, and among them, not more than a dozen
bidders.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>By way of recognition to the King of Prussia for his being
sponsor of the Prince of Wales, the Queen sent him some presents,
which, if the <i>Wurtzburg Gazette</i> is to be credited, were of
somewhat mixed description.&nbsp; 1.&mdash;A cradle with the
figure of nurse holding an infant, representing the Prince of
Wales, in her arms, all of pure gold.&nbsp; 2.&mdash;A pistol,
which, when the trigger is pulled, opens and exhibits a

<p>There was a great flutter of excitement over the Queen&rsquo;s
Fancy Dress Ball, which took place in the Throne Room of
Buckingham Palace on 12th May.&nbsp; Its leading feature was the
assembling and meeting of the two Courts of Anne of Bretagne (the
Duchess of Cambridge) and Edward III. and Queen Phillipa (The
Queen and Prince Albert).</p>
<p>A separate entrance to the Palace was set apart for the Court
of Brittany, the Duchess of Cambridge assembling her Court in one
of the lower rooms of the Palace, while the Queen and Prince
Albert, surrounded by a numerous and brilliant circle, prepared
to receive her Royal Highness in the Throne Room, which was
altered so far, as to be made as much as possible to harmonise
with the period.&nbsp; The throne was removed and another
erected, copied from an authentic source, of the time of Edward
III.&nbsp; It was lined (as well as the whole alcove in which it
was placed) with purple velvet, having worked on it, in gold, the
Crown of England, the Cross of St. George, and emblazoned shields
with the Arms of England and France.&nbsp; The state chairs were
as near those of the period as the arch&aelig;ology of the time
could compass, and the throne was surrounded with Gothic
tracery.&nbsp; At the back of the throne were emblazoned the
Royal Arms of England in silver.&nbsp; Seated on this throne, the
Queen and Prince Albert awaited the arrival of Anne <!-- page
188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>of
Bretagne, which, ushered in by heralds, took place at half-past
ten.</p>
<p>The various characters then formed a procession divided into
Quadrilles, the French, German, Spanish, Italian, Highland,
Russian, Waverley and Crusaders Quadrilles, and marched into the
Ball Room, where dancing at once commenced, the Queen and Prince
Albert watching the scene, seated on a <i>haut pas</i>.&nbsp; At
one o&rsquo;clock, the Earl of Liverpool, the Lord Steward,
conducted the Queen and Prince Albert to supper; and when they
had finished the guests were attended to.&nbsp; After supper, the
Queen danced a quadrille with Prince George of Cambridge, their
<i>vis-a-vis</i> being the Duchess of Buccleugh and the Duke of
Beaufort; then some reels were danced, and the Queen retired at
half-past two.</p>
<p>This account would be strangely incomplete without some
account of two or three of the principal dresses, to give an idea
of the splendour of the show.&nbsp; The Queen&rsquo;s petticoat
was of red velvet, trimmed with ermine.&nbsp; The ground of the
jacket was garter blue, with a large pattern of leaves woven in
it, of gold, and ornamented with precious stones; hanging
sleeves, lined with ermine.&nbsp; The mantle was of cloth of
gold, worked in silver, and trimmed with gold lace and pearls,
lined with ermine, and fastened in front with a broad gold band,
worked in diamonds and other precious stones.&nbsp; Her shoes
were red silk, worked with gold and diamonds.</p>
<p>The crown was a <i>fac-simile</i> of that worn by Queen
Philippa, and was ornamented with diamonds and precious
stones.&nbsp; Under the crown, descending to the sides of the
face, was a network of red velvet and diamonds.</p>
<p>Prince Albert&rsquo;s under dress, of a garter-blue ground,
was worked in large gold flowers, lined with red silk.&nbsp; The
collar and cuffs were ornamented with diamonds and precious
stones.&nbsp; The cloak was of red velvet, trimmed with gold lace
and pearls, and was fastened in front with a band of diamonds and
different coloured precious stones, and was lined with
ermine.&nbsp; His hose were of red silk, and he wore shoes of red
velvet, embroidered with gold and satin.&nbsp; His crown was that
of Edward III., ornamented with diamonds and precious <!-- page
189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>stones.&nbsp; The sword-belt was of red velvet, studded
with rosettes of gold and diamonds; the sword was richly
ornamented with the rose, thistle, oak, and shamrock, in diamonds
and precious stones, the cross, forming the handle, containing
some very large emeralds.</p>
<p>The mantle of the Duchess of Cambridge, as Anne of Bretagne,
was of crimson velvet, bordered with ermine, looped up at the
sides, displaying the petticoat of cloth of silver, worked in
silver and gold, fastened with diamond ornaments; the top was
edged with two rows of large pearls, having between them a
variety of ornaments, formed of sapphires, emeralds and diamonds;
the lower row of pearls had beneath it a fringe of large
diamonds, formed into drops.&nbsp; The stomacher had rows of
large pearls, of very great value, mixed with diamonds.&nbsp;
Extending from the stomacher to the bottom of the mantle were
rosettes and other ornaments of diamonds, sapphires and emeralds,
forming a broad band down the mantle.&nbsp; The <i>ceinture</i>
was also composed of brilliants, emeralds and sapphires.&nbsp;
The sleeves were fastened with diamonds and sapphires, and the
necklace was of emeralds and brilliants.</p>
<p>The diadem was composed wholly of pearls and diamonds, except
the <i>fleur de lys</i> by which it was surmounted, which was
composed of emeralds and sapphires.&nbsp; The head-dress was
decorated with two rows of large diamonds and one of
pearls.&nbsp; The veil was of gold tulle.</p>
<p>The Duke of Beaufort having been selected by the Duchess of
Cambridge to personate Louis XII., in the French Quadrille, of
which Her Royal Highness was the leader, His Grace appeared in
one of the most splendid dresses handed down by Monfaucon, in his
<i>Monarchie Francaise</i>.&nbsp; The dress consisted of rich
blue velvet, sumptuously embroidered in gold, with which were
intermixed rubies, emeralds, pearls and other precious stones,
with a large diamond star in the centre, and an opal, of
priceless value, set with diamonds.&nbsp; The cloak was of cloth
of gold, lined with white satin, and trimmed over with powdered
ermine.&nbsp; The belt worn by the Noble Duke, on this occasion,
was of crimson, richly studded with <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>precious
stones, and fastened in the centre by a large diamond
buckle.&nbsp; Sword, a valuable specimen of the art of that
period, the hilt being of gold, exquisitely chased; a crimson
velvet hat with feathers, confined in the front by a costly
jewel.</p>
<p>Space prevents my giving any more of the dresses, and I only
notice that the Earl of Cardigan appeared in the French
Quadrille, clad in armour, as <i>Bayard</i>, <i>the</i>
&ldquo;<i>Chevalier sans reproche</i>&rdquo;!!!</p>
<p>As almost everyone&rsquo;s dress was ablaze with diamonds and
other jewels, it is pleasant to think, that very few losses were
sustained, and those were, generally, of trifling value.&nbsp;
The only loss of any moment was that sustained by Prince Albert,
from the girdle of whose gorgeous dress, is supposed to have
dropped a valuable brilliant of great size.</p>
<p>On 30 May, about half-past six in the evening, as the Queen
was returning from her usual drive, and was close to Buckingham
Palace, she was fired at by a young miscreant named John Francis,
aged 20, described as a carpenter.&nbsp; He was at once seized,
and examined by the Privy Council.&nbsp; The simplest account of
the event was given at the boy&rsquo;s trial by Col. Arbuthnot,
one of the Queen&rsquo;s equerries, whose testimony was as
follows: &ldquo;My general position is about five yards in the
rear of Her Majesty.&nbsp; Before we left the Palace, I had
received an intimation which induced me to ride as close to Her
Majesty as I could; and Colonel Wylde, Prince Albert&rsquo;s
equerry, rode in the same position, on the other side.&nbsp;
Between 6 and 7 o&rsquo;clock, we were coming down Constitution
Hill, when, about halfway down the Hill, I observed the prisoner;
and, on the carriage reaching him, he took a pistol from his
side, and fired it in the direction of the Queen.&nbsp; As
quickly as I could, I pulled up my horse, and gave the prisoner
into custody.&nbsp; The prisoner had, before this, caught my
attention as appearing anxious to see Her Majesty.&nbsp; The
Colonel went on to say that the utmost distance from the
carriage, when Francis fired, was seven feet.&nbsp; The
<i>cort&eacute;ge</i> had been going at the rate of eleven miles
an hour; but the Colonel had given instructions at this spot, to
go faster, and the postillions were driving at the rate of twelve
or thirteen <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>miles an hour.&nbsp; The Queen was
sitting on the back seat of the carriage, on the side nearest to
the prisoner.&nbsp; The pistol seemed to the witness to be
pointed in the direct line of Her Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the news being communicated to the Houses of Parliament,
they adjourned in confusion, as it was found impossible to carry
on the public business whilst in that state of excitement.&nbsp;
Next day both Houses voted congratulatory addresses, and the same
were sent by every corporate body throughout the Kingdom.&nbsp;
The Queen, who could not fail to be affected by this attempt upon
her life, nevertheless attended the Opera the same evening, and
met with a most enthusiastic reception.</p>
<p>Francis was tried, on the charge of High Treason, at the
Central Criminal Court, on 17 June, and found guilty; there being
no reasonable doubt but that the pistol was loaded with something
more than gunpowder.&nbsp; His sentence was: &ldquo;That you,
John Francis, be taken from hence to the place from whence you
came, that you be drawn from thence on a hurdle to the place of
execution, and that you be hanged by the neck until you be dead:
that your head be, afterwards, severed from your body, and that
your body be divided into four quarters, to be disposed of in
such manner as Her Majesty shall deem fit.&nbsp; And the Lord
have mercy on your soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sentence was commuted to transportation for life, and on
6 July he left Newgate for Gosport, and he was sent to Norfolk
Island by the first transport sailing thither.</p>
<p>This mania for shooting at the Queen was infectious.&nbsp; If
Oxford had not been treated so leniently, there would have been
no Francis; and if there had been no Francis, there would have
been no Bean.&nbsp; This was another young miscreant, aged 18,
deformed, and very short.&nbsp; It was on Sunday, 3 July, when
the Queen was going from Buckingham Palace to the Chapel Royal,
St. James&rsquo;s, that, in the Mall, this boy was seen to
present a pistol at the Queen.&nbsp; A young man named Dassett
saw the act, and this is a resum&eacute; of his evidence at the
trial on 25 Aug.: He said he saw the royal carriages coming
along, and saw the prisoner come from the <!-- page 192--><a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>crowd, draw
a pistol from his breast, and present it at the carriage, at
arm&rsquo;s length, and breast high; and then he heard the click
of a pistol hammer upon the pan; but there was no
explosion.&nbsp; He seized him, and, assisted by his brother,
took him across the Mall, and gave him to Police Constable Hearn,
who said &ldquo;it did not amount to a charge.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Another policeman, likewise, refused to take the prisoner, who
only asked to have his pistol back again.&nbsp; The pressure of
the crowd was so great, that he was obliged to let Bean go; and,
afterwards, the people said that witness himself had been
shooting at the Queen, and a policeman took the pistol away from
him.</p>
<p>In his cross-examination, Dassett said that some person in the
crowd laughed, and others called out that the pistol was not
loaded.&nbsp; An Inspector of Police deposed to having received
the pistol from witness, and he unloaded it; the charge was not
large, and consisted of coarse gunpowder, some short pieces of
tobacco pipe, and four small pieces of gravel.</p>
<p>Bean got away for a time, but was, afterwards, captured and
tried, found guilty, and sentenced to 18 months&rsquo;
imprisonment in Millbank Penitentiary.</p>
<p>The old Duke of Cambridge (the Queen&rsquo;s uncle) had a
fright, on the 6 July, when he was at a f&ecirc;te at Jesus
College, Cambridge, for he lost the diamond star from his breast,
valued at &pound;500.&nbsp; Everybody thought it had been stolen
by an expert thief, but it was afterwards found by a Police
Inspector, in the gardens, much trodden on, and with three
diamonds missing; so it was &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well that ends
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was great distress in the manufacturing districts, and
disturbances originating in a strike for higher wages, were
inflamed by the Chartists, and other political agitators.&nbsp;
Beginning in Lancashire, the riots spread through Cheshire,
Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Yorkshire, and, finally, extended
to the manufacturing towns of Scotland, and the collieries of
Wales.&nbsp; There were conflicts with the military, and people
were killed; altogether, matters were very serious.</p>
<p>It was better in London.&nbsp; On 19 Aug. a Chartist meeting
was to be held on Clerkenwell Green, but plenty of police <!--
page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>were there to meet them.&nbsp; Most of the mob were
discouraged, and went home, but the police were obliged to arrest
some 50 of them, and some banners were captured.&nbsp; Then they
went to Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, and in Long Acre, they came
into collision with the police, and some damage was done.&nbsp;
So serious was the outlook, that all the military in the
Metropolis and the suburbs were kept under arms, and there were
large reserves of police at every Station House; and, next day,
the magistrate, at Bow Street, had a busy day, hearing cases
arising from this outbreak.&nbsp; On the 22nd Aug. there were
Chartist meetings at Clerkenwell Green and Paddington (the latter
numbering upwards of 10,000), but the worst cases were managed by
the police, and no very great harm came of them.</p>
<p>On 22 June, Sir Robt. Peel&rsquo;s Bill, imposing an Income
Tax, received the Royal sanction.&nbsp; It is 5 and 6 Vic., c.
35: &ldquo;An Act for granting Her Majesty Duties on Profits
arising from Property, Professions, Trades, and Offices, until
the 6th day of April, 1845.&rdquo;&nbsp; We see that it was
imposed only for three years, but the Old Man of the Sea, once on
the popular back, has never come off; and, in all probability,
never will.&nbsp; It began at 7d. in the pound, has been as high
as 16d., and as low as 2d.&nbsp; There is in <i>Blackwood&rsquo;s
Magazine</i> for Aug., 1842:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span

But, thence arose this Income Tax.</p>
<p>Ye bagmen bold, ye lovers fond,<br />
Who daily like to correspond,<br />
Remember, as you break the wax,<br />
Cheap postage means an Income Tax.</p>
<p>Ye noisy fools, who made a rout<br />

They anger&rsquo;d, too, the poor Chinese,<br />
The Mandarins have shown their backs,<br />
But war soon brings an Income Tax.</p>
<p>Yet now I hope the new tariff<br />

On him who calls for Income Tax.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The day of reckoning for the Rioters of August duly came, and
both at York and Salford Assizes many were punished, and at the
end of September Feargus O&rsquo;Connor was arrested in London
for sedition, as were other Chartist leaders at Manchester and
Leeds.&nbsp; In October, more rioters were tried, and sentenced,
at Stafford and Liverpool.</p>
<p>Even women meddled with Chartism, and on 17 Oct. a <!-- page
195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>meeting of female Chartists was held at the National
Charter Association in the Old Bailey, to form a female Chartist
Association to co-operate with the original society.&nbsp; A Mr.
Cohen created some dissatisfaction by speaking <i>against</i> the
interposition of women in political affairs; he &ldquo;put it to
the mothers present, whether they did not find themselves more
happy in the peacefulness and usefulness of the domestic hearth,
than in coming forth in public, and aspiring after political
rights?&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Inge asked Mr. Cohen, did he not
consider women qualified to fill public offices? it did not
require much &ldquo;physical force&rdquo; to vote!&nbsp; Mr.
Cohen replied with an <i>argumentum ad
f&oelig;minam</i>:&mdash;He would, with all humility and respect,
ask the young lady, what sort of office she would aspire to
fill?&nbsp; If she would fill one, she would fill all?&nbsp; He
was not going to treat the question with ridicule; but he would
ask her to suppose herself in the House of Commons, as Member for
a Parliamentary Borough, and that a young gentleman, a lover, in
that House, were to try to influence her vote, through his sway
over her affections; how would she act? whether, in other words,
she could resist, and might not lose sight of the public
interests?&nbsp; (Order!&nbsp; Order!)&nbsp; He wished to be in
order.&nbsp; He was for maintaining the <i>social</i> rights of
women; <i>political</i> rights, such as he understood that
meeting to aspire to, she could never, in his opinion,
attain.&nbsp; This drew forth an energetic speech from Miss Mary
Anne Walker; she &ldquo;repudiated, with indignation, the
insinuation that, if women were in Parliament, any man, be he
husband, or be he lover, would dare to be so base a scoundrel as
to attempt to sway her from the strict line of duty.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Miss Walker was much applauded; and, after the business of the
evening, she received the thanks of the meeting.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the <i>Times</i> of Oct. 5, there is a paragraph about a
gipsey trial, and as that curious nomad race is fast
disappearing, it may prove of interest to my readers:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A short time since, a very remarkable
circumstance took place in the New Forest, Hampshire, in the
instance of a gipsey, named Lee, being cast out of the
fraternity.&nbsp; The <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>spot where the scene took place was
at Bolton&rsquo;s Bench, near Lyndhurst.&nbsp; Between 300 and
400 gipsies, belonging to different tribes, including the Lees,
Stanleys, and Coopers, were assembled upon this unusual
occasion.&nbsp; The concourse consisted of a great many females;
and so secretly had the meeting been got up, that scarcely a
person residing in the neighbourhood was aware that a
circumstance of the sort was about to take place.&nbsp; The
offender, a handsome-looking man, apparently between 38 and 40
years of age, was placed in the middle of a ring, composed of the
King of the Gipsies, and the patriarchs of different
tribes.&nbsp; This ring was followed by a second, made up of the
male portion of the assembly; and an exterior circle was formed
by the women.&nbsp; The King (one of the Lees), who was a
venerable old man, and one who looked as though he had seen
upwards of 90 summers, then addressed the culprit for nearly an
hour, but in a tongue that was perfectly strange to the
bystanders.&nbsp; The address was delivered in a most impressive
manner, as might be conceived by the vehemence of the
gesticulations which accompanied it.&nbsp; None but the gipsies
themselves had the slightest knowledge of the crime which had
been committed by the offender, but it must have been one
evidently very obnoxious to the tribe, as the act of expulsion
from among them is an exceedingly rare occurrence.&nbsp; As soon
as the King had finished his speech to the condemned man, he
turned round, and harangued the whole of the gipsies assembled;
and, expressing himself in English, he informed them that Jacob
Lee had been expelled from among them, that he was no longer one
of their fraternity, and that he must leave the camp of the
gipsies for ever.&nbsp; The King, then advancing towards him,
spat upon him, and the circle which enclosed him simultaneously
opened to admit of his retreating from among them, while they
smote him with branches of trees, as he left the ground.&nbsp;
The meeting then broke up, and the parties assembled went their
different ways; some of them having come some considerable
distance, in order to be present at the tribunal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early in November Mr. J. Simon, LL.B., was called to the <!--
page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>Bar, being the first Jewish barrister connected with
the Middle Temple.&nbsp; A Hebrew bible had to be obtained, on
which he could be sworn, and a difficulty having arisen, owing to
the custom of Jews putting on their hats when taking an oath, the
size of the wig rendering it impossible in this case, it was
ruled that the head was sufficiently covered by the wig.</p>
<p>On 31 May, 1842, an Act (5 &amp; 6 Vic., c. 22) was passed for
the demolition of the Fleet prison, and on 30 Nov., the records,
books, etc., and the remaining prisoners, seventy in number, were
removed to the Queen&rsquo;s prison.&nbsp; The Marshalsea was
also closed, and its three prisoners were also transferred.&nbsp;
The Fleet had been a prison ever since the time of William the
Conqueror.</p>
<p>Writing about the Fleet prison sets one thinking of the
marriages solemnized within its rules, and there is an entry in
one of the registers: &ldquo;The Woman ran across Ludgate Hill in
her shift.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the <i>Times</i> of 15 Dec., I find
the following, copied from the <i>Boston Herald</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Gedney</span>.&mdash;A
most extravagant exhibition took place here on Friday.&nbsp; A
widow, named Farrow, having four children, was married to a man
named David Wilkinson; and the woman having been told that if she
was married, covered by nothing but a sheet, her husband would
not be answerable for her debts, actually had the hardihood to go
to church with nothing on but a sheet, sewn up like a sack, with
holes in the sides for her arms, and in this way was
married.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have come across several instances of
this vulgar error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 3rd Dec. was tried a famous gambling case which ended
in the discomfiture of a notorious gaming-house keeper, named
Bond.&nbsp; It was a case in the Court of Exchequer&mdash;Smith
<i>v.</i> Bond.&nbsp; At the gaming house kept by the latter, the
game played was, usually, &ldquo;French Hazard&rdquo;; and
persons of rank were in the habit of staking large sums against
the &ldquo;bank&rdquo; held by Bond, to whom reverted all the
profits of the game; in one evening they amounted to &pound;2,000
or &pound;3,000.&nbsp; Considerable losses were sustained, on
various occasions, by <!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span

<p class="gutsumm">Murder of Mr. Drummond&mdash;Rebecca and her
Daughters&mdash;Spread of the Movement through Wales&mdash;Its
End&mdash;Rebecca Dramatised&mdash;Rebecca in London.</p>
<p>The year opened badly, with the assassination of Edward
Drummond, Esqre., the private secretary of Sir Robert Peel.&nbsp;
Walking quietly down Parliament Street, he was suddenly fired at
by a man named Daniel McNaughton.&nbsp; Poor Mr. Drummond did not
die at once, but lingered for a few hours.&nbsp; It was believed
by very many people, myself among the number, that it was a
political assassination, the Secretary being taken for the
Premier, but the man got off on a plea of insanity, a plea which
was very fashionable in favour of criminals at that time, and
highly conducive to their benefit.</p>
<p>An episode in the Social History of England, almost unknown to
the rising generation, was the reappearance, in Wales, of
&ldquo;Rebecca and her daughters,&rdquo; a riotous mob, whose
grievance was, at first, purely local&mdash;they resisted the
heavy and vexatious tolls, to which, by the mismanagement and
abuses of the turnpike system, they were subjected.&nbsp; Galled
by this burden, to which they were rendered more sensitive by
reason of their poverty, and hopeless of obtaining any assistance
or relief by legitimate means, the people resolved to take the
law in their own hands, and abate the source of so much annoyance
and distress by the strong arm.</p>
<p>The first act of destruction of the toll gates occurred in
1839, and the gates then destroyed were particularly obnoxious to
the people, who entertained doubts of the legality of their
erection.&nbsp; They were broken down in open day, with no
attempt at concealment, by a mob of persons rather in a spirit
<!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>of mischievous frolic than otherwise.&nbsp; The
proposal to re-erect these gates, on the part of the trustees,
was overruled by a large body of magistrates and gentlemen, many
of whom qualified for trustees expressly for the occasion.&nbsp;
This decision gave strength and encouragement to the
discontented, and, no doubt, prepared the way for further
violence.&nbsp; The gate breakers had learned their power and
though they did not immediately renew the exercise of it, the
lesson was not forgotten, although it slumbered until the
commencement of 1843, when it appeared in a systematic and
organised form.</p>
<p>This organization was called &ldquo;Rebecca and her
daughters,&rdquo; their leader having taken this scriptural name
from a misconception of the meaning of <i>Genesis</i> xxiv., 60:
&ldquo;And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her. . . .
&lsquo;let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate
them.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; This captain of the gate breakers in
the guise of a woman, always made her marches and attacks by
night, and her conduct of the campaign manifested no small
dexterity and address.&nbsp; A sudden blowing of horns and firing
of guns announced the arrival of the assailants at the turnpike
selected for attack.&nbsp; They were mounted on horseback, and
generally appeared in considerable force.&nbsp; The leader, who
gave the word of command, and directed the motion of those whom
she called her daughters, was attired in a female dress of some
description, wearing, also, a bonnet, or head-dress, which served
the purpose of disguise.&nbsp; Her bodyguard were dressed up in
similar manner.</p>
<p>Immediately on arriving at the gate, they commenced the
business of the night, and proceeded to raze gate, posts, and
tollhouse, with an alacrity and perseverance which soon
accomplished its purpose.&nbsp; They, generally, sawed off the
gate posts close to the ground, broke the gate to fragments, and
pulled down the toll-house to its foundations.&nbsp; To show that
the abatement of the specific grievance was their only object,
they, commonly, dealt very leniently with the toll-keeper,
offering him, except in rare cases, no personal violence, and
allowing him to remove his furniture and property, which they
never attempted to destroy or plunder.&nbsp; The work was <!--
page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>no sooner done than the mysterious assailants galloped
off, firing their guns, and blowing their horns, as before.&nbsp;
No trace nor clue was to be found of the quarter whence they had
come, or of the retreats to which they dispersed themselves; nor
did anything in the outward appearance of the country, by day,
even when these nightly outrages were at their height, give sign
of the extension and compact organization which evidently
subsisted among the population.</p>

<p>The first notice I can find (in this year) of these riots is
in the <i>Times</i> of 10 Jan., in which is the following
paragraph from the <i>Welshman</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The state of society in Wales may surprise
some of our English readers, especially when we acquaint them
with the fact, that there has been, for some months past, in the
neighbourhood of St. Clear, a mob of lawless depredators,
amounting to about 600, who assembled nightly, for the purpose of
destroying the turnpike gates on the various lines of road in the
neighbourhood of St. Clear.&nbsp; These ruffians are headed by a
very tall man, dressed, for disguise, as a female, who <!-- page
202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>goes by the name of Rebecca; and, as many of his
associates are likewise dressed as females, the whole gang have
been christened &lsquo;Rebecca and her daughters.&rsquo;&nbsp;
These men are nearly all ably mounted, and are a terror to the
neighbouring country.&nbsp; The Pwiltrap gate has been destroyed
a great number of times and as frequently replaced by the
trustees of the road; but, immediately after its re-erection, the
fellows have invariably assembled in greater force than before;
and, riding up to the gate, the following interesting colloquy
has taken place.&nbsp; The leader of the mob, addressing the
others in Welsh, says, &lsquo;My children this gate has no
business here, has it?&rsquo; to which her children reply, that
it has not; the mother again asks, what is to be done with it,
when the children reply, that it should be levelled with the
ground.&nbsp; They then immediately break it down, and disperse
in different directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This system has continued for a length of time; and,
although a reward of &pound;50 has been offered, not one of the
offenders has been discovered.&nbsp; About 100 constables have
been sworn in, and three constables from London are down there;
but all precautions are ineffectual; for so surely as the
constables show the slightest diminution of their vigilance,
Rebecca and her daughters appear, and level the gates.&nbsp; A
very short time ago, the policemen were after a fellow whom they
suspected to belong to the gang and, while at a public house,
baiting their horse, Rebecca and her daughters suddenly came in
sight, and the affrighted officers of the law were obliged to fly
for their lives.&nbsp; The gates have now been re-erected, and no
fresh act of violence has occurred since the 16th ult., but the
organisation of the depredators still continues; and, it is
feared, will break out with fresh violence if the constabulary
force be removed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That this movement was serious and no joke, is evidenced by
the fact that I have, in my notes, 45 paragraphs in the
<i>Times</i> on the subject.</p>
<p>From Pembroke and Caermarthen, it gradually spread to
Cardiganshire, on one side, and to Radnorshire and
Glamorganshire, on the other.&nbsp; Brecknockshire, alone of the
South <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>Wales counties, enjoyed exemption
from these disturbances.&nbsp; The destruction which the rioters
effected in some of these districts was most extensive and
unsparing.&nbsp; There were, at the time of the outbreak, between
100 and 150 gates, including side bars and chains, in the county
of Caermarthen; of these, no less than between 70 and 80 were
destroyed, the toll-houses, as well as the gates and posts,
being, in many cases, razed to the ground; in some trusts not a
single gate was left standing.&nbsp; In Pembrokeshire, and in one
of the divisions of Cardiganshire, the destruction was carried on
in the same wholesale manner.&nbsp; The trustees, at first,
re-erected the gates which had been broken down, but they were
again as speedily demolished by the rioters; again they were
rebuilt, and again they were levelled with the ground.&nbsp; The
trustees were, at length, compelled to desist, and the roads were
left free of toll.&nbsp; None of these counties, except
Glamorgan, possessed a paid constabulary, or any other force
which could be of avail in checking the proceedings of the
rioters; and the magistrates finding all local efforts
unavailing, were obliged to appeal to Government for protection
and support.</p>
<p>One of the boldest steps ventured on by the insurgents, whose
confidence was, of course, much increased by their uninterrupted
success, was an entry, which was made, at midday, into the town
of Caermarthen, by a large body of persons on the 10th of
June.&nbsp; About noon, the rioters began to march into the town,
through the Water Street gate, which they had destroyed some time
before.&nbsp; They were headed by a band.&nbsp; The leading body
consisted of some thousands on foot, many of whom were Chartists
and rabble of the town; a large number of women was among the
crowd, and men bearing inflammatory placards.&nbsp; They were
followed by a man in disguise, representing Rebecca; some bearing
brooms with which to sweep the foundations of the tollhouse and
the workhouse, and the rear was brought up by about 300 farmers
on horseback.&nbsp; They paraded the town, passing the Hall and
hooting the magistrates, and proceeded to the workhouse, which
they attacked.&nbsp; They climbed over the high wall with which
the building was surrounded, and then burst open <!-- page
204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>the lodge gates and the porter&rsquo;s door; the
horsemen rode into the yard, and surrounded the premises; and the
rioters on foot soon forced an entrance into the building, and
commenced their work of destruction.&nbsp; While the rioters were
in the act of pulling down the inner doors and partitions of the
Board Room, and other parts of the premises, and pitching the
beds out of windows, the governor was ringing the alarm bell;
and, in the midst of the tumult, came the military.</p>
<p>Representations of the excited state of the neighbourhood had
been sent to the Home Office, and a troop of the 4th Light
Dragoons had been ordered from Cardiff.&nbsp; An express from
Caermarthen had met the Dragoons at four o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, just after they had passed through Neath, and were still
31 miles from their destination.&nbsp; They pushed on, riding the
last 15 miles in an hour and a half, two horses dying from
fatigue as they entered the town.&nbsp; They were met by one of
the Magistrates, who led them to the Workhouse and read the Riot
Act.&nbsp; The rioters were summoned to surrender; but they made
an attempt to rush on the military.&nbsp; The Dragoons charged,
using the flat of their swords, and soon put the rioters, outside
the wall, to flight.&nbsp; Those within offered some resistance;
and, for a moment, the edge of the sword was turned upon them,
when they succumbed.&nbsp; Many escaped over the wall; but about
100 were taken prisoners, and several horses were abandoned by
their riders.&nbsp; The disturbance which menaced so seriously
the safety of the town, was thus happily put an end to, without
any bloodshed or calamitous result.</p>
<p>As time advanced, the insurrection, which had at first been
lightly thought of, and for which much allowance had been made,
under the belief that the people had real grievances to complain
of, assumed a more malignant and dangerous aspect.&nbsp; The
farmers and peasantry, who in their impatience under the
vexations of the tolls, had commenced it, soon fell into the
hands of ill-disposed and designing men, who aggravated the
excitement that prevailed, and availed themselves of the name and
disguise of &ldquo;Rebecca,&rdquo; in order to carry out their
own evil and lawless purposes.&nbsp; Threatening <!-- page
205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>letters were one of the means most freely resorted to;
and great numbers, under the signature of &ldquo;Rebecca,&rdquo;
were sent about the country, conveying the most sanguinary
menaces to those whose conduct had, in any way, given offence to
the dastardly writers.&nbsp; Certain rules were laid down by
conclaves of the disaffected, respecting the occupation of farms;
and all who presumed to contradict the edicts of this invisible
authority, were marked out, and denounced as victims to the just
vengeance of Rebecca.&nbsp; The more active magistrates, as well
as the tithe-owners and clergy, were made the special objects of
this cowardly system of intimidation.&nbsp; In some instances,
the rioters proved that their threats were not without
meaning.&nbsp; Guns were fired into the houses of persons who had
fallen under the popular displeasure.&nbsp; Some had their
property fired, or otherwise injured; and a growing feeling of
alarm and insecurity began to pervade the peaceable and
well-disposed portion of the community.&nbsp; This feeling was
further increased by a cold-blooded and shocking act of murder,
committed on a poor old woman who kept a turnpike, called the
Hendy gate, on the confines of Glamorganshire and
Caermarthenshire.&nbsp; A party of rioters came to attack the
gate at which she lived, and one of the number, actuated by some
motive which was not distinctly accounted for, fired at her, and
shot her dead.&nbsp; A coroner&rsquo;s inquest sat upon the body,
and all the facts attending the revolting transaction were fully
and clearly stated in evidence; but, such was the excitement of
feeling then prevailing in the neighbourhood, or such the
influence of fear exercised over the minds of the jurymen who
investigated the case, that they actually brought in a verdict:
&ldquo;That the deceased died from suffusion of blood, which
produced suffocation, but from what cause, is, to the jurors,
unknown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the continuance of these outrages, which threatened,
&rsquo;ere long, to disorganise society, and render the tenure of
life and property, in Wales, insecure, the Government were, at
length, aroused to the necessity of adopting very vigorous
measures for the enforcement and vindication of the law.&nbsp; A
large body of troops was sent down to Wales, and a general <!--
page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>officer, of skill and experience, appointed to the
command of the disturbed districts.&nbsp; A strong body of London
police was imported, to exercise their skill in ferreting out the
actors in these lawless exploits, who had so long succeeded in
eluding detection.&nbsp; The districts most infested by the
Rebeccaites were closely occupied by parties of soldiers, some of
whom were quartered, at short intervals, in the villages and
hamlets wherein mischief was suspected to lurk, and in the
neighbourhood of turnpike gates, which had, previously, been the
objects of attack.&nbsp; It was not, however, the policy of the
insurgents to place themselves in open collision with the
soldiers; but the clandestine and shifting mode of warfare which
they had adopted with so much success, was but imperfectly
counteracted by the presence of a military force.&nbsp; Under
cover of the night, and with the advantages afforded by a
knowledge of the country, and the sympathy of the population,
they could sweep down a gate, which was but the work of a few
minutes, with very little risk of interruption or
discovery.&nbsp; The presence of the police and soldiers, if it
could not entirely put an end to the attacks on the turnpikes,
prevented the disaffected from proceeding to further acts of
violence, and checked the growth of a conspiracy which might,
otherwise, have gone to the full length of open rebellion.&nbsp;
From this, and other causes, the spirit of disturbance in Wales
began to decline, about the latter end of the summer.&nbsp; The
most obnoxious of the turnpike gates had been swept away; and, on
some of the trusts, the trustees had announced their
determination not to re-erect those which were most complained of
as oppressive.&nbsp; Some of the more active leaders of the riots
were captured, in an affray with the County police, on the
borders of Glamorganshire, and the terrors of a Special
Commission impended over the Principality.</p>
<p>The movement was even dramatised, and on 20 Sep., at the Royal
Amphitheatre, Liverpool, was produced a new play, called:
&ldquo;Rebecca and her Daughters; or, Paddy the Policeman&rdquo;;
the programme of scenery etc., as described on the play bill
being: &ldquo;Vigilance of the civil and military <!-- page
207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>authorities; &pound;100 reward for the apprehension of
Rebecca, and &pound;10 for each of her daughters; False alarm;
Invincible courage of the Yeomanry; Arrival of the London Police
in disguise; Paddy Whack undertakes to capture the delinquents;
Admonitions to the Constabulary; The inspection; Mysterious
appearance of Rebecca and her daughters in the Glen of Llandilo,
at midnight; Tried before the Justice of the Peace; Happy
<i>denouement</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can find only one reference to Rebecca in connection with
London&mdash;and that refers to a bar in Gower Street, which was
taken down some few years since.&nbsp; It occurs in the
<i>Times</i> of 30 Sep.: &ldquo;During the last two or three
days, considerable excitement has prevailed in the northern
suburbs of the Metropolis, in consequence of rumours obtaining
circulation that threatening notices had been posted about,
signed, &lsquo;Rebecca,&rsquo; intimating that it was the
intention of that lady and her daughters to destroy the various
turnpike and other gates, which they were pleased to term
&lsquo;public obstructions.&rsquo;&nbsp; It appears that these
rumours were not altogether unfounded; for, whether intended as a
joke, or otherwise, the doings of the notorious Rebecca and her
daughters in Wales, have, in reality, found persons foolhardy
enough to follow their example in London.&nbsp; A few evenings
since, Mr. Hill, the porter and keeper of the gate at the London
University College, which crosses Gower Street, and prevents
carriages from passing along the front of University College
Hospital, received a letter, with the signature of
&lsquo;Rebecca&rsquo; attached, declaring it to be the intention
of herself and others to remove the &lsquo;obstruction called a
gate&rsquo; on the following night.&nbsp; Mr. Hill, thinking the
matter a joke, took no notice of the circumstance; but, to his
astonishment, early in the morning following the night on which
the threatened attack was promised, he was awakened by the night
porter, who informed him that the gate (a large wooden one, such
as the ordinary toll bars) was gone.&nbsp; On examination, it was
found that not only had the large padlock by which it was
fastened, been broken and carried away, but the gate had
absolutely been filed off its hinges, and conveyed by the
depredators into the College <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>grounds,
and hidden behind some shrubs.&nbsp; The gate has again been
re-instated; but, since the occurrence, Mr. Hill has received
another threatening notice, informing him that it is the
intention of Rebecca and her daughters, on Monday night next, to
effect its entire destruction.&nbsp; What is most extraordinary
in connection with the affair is, that the gate should have been
removed without the knowledge of the police, the beats of two
constables joining close to the spot, or that of the night
porters, either at the College, or the Hospital.&nbsp; It is to
be remarked that frequent complaints have been made at the
erection of the gate in question, as it interrupts the otherwise
direct communication between Holborn and Broad Street,
Bloomsbury, with the Hampstead Road, and compels carriages, etc.,
to go considerably out of the way round Sussex and University
Streets, before they can get into the New Road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this time, Gretna Green marriages were in full blast (they
were only made unlawful in 1856), and we learn from the
<i>Carlisle Journal</i>, copied into the <i>Times</i> of 20 Feb.,
something about the Parsons: &ldquo;We observe by announcement in
some of the London papers, that some worthy gentlemen in London,
are about to enlighten the public on the subject of Gretna Green
marriages, by the publication of a book called <i>The Gretna
Green Memoirs</i>, by Robert Elliott, with an introduction and
appendix by the Rev. Caleb Brown.&nbsp; In addition to this
information, we have been honoured with a copy of what Mr.
Elliott calls a &lsquo;cercler,&rsquo; which he is desirous we
should publish as a paragraph for the benefit of our
readers.&nbsp; From this &lsquo;cercler&rsquo; we learn that
&lsquo;this interesting work contains an accurate account of
remarkable elopements, pursuits, anecdotes, etc., never before
published.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then we are further informed that there
is &lsquo;in the press,&rsquo; to be published by subscription,
<i>The Gretna Green Register</i>, containing the names of 7,744
persons married by Robert Elliott, the Gretna Green Parson.&nbsp;
It is added, that &lsquo;the whole is being carefully printed
from the original registers, written and kept by
himself.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Gretna Green Parson, we suspect, has
fallen into dishonest hands, or he would not have suffered it to
be said that he was about to publish registers which never had
existence.&nbsp; The Gretna Green Parson is pretty well known in
this neighbourhood.&nbsp; He married a grand daughter of old Joe
Paisley, <!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>the &lsquo;original&rsquo;
blacksmith; and, after the death of that worthy
&lsquo;parson,&rsquo; he set up an opposition shop, in the
marriage line to David Laing, who had acquired some notoriety in
the business.&nbsp; This was in 1811, and he continued to
&lsquo;trade&rsquo; until 1822, when it either fell away from
him, or he from it.&nbsp; His reverence subsequently condescended
to act as horsekeeper, or hostler, at one of the inns in this
city, and a few months ago was sent for to London, as a witness,
in some marriage case, and is now set up as an author!&nbsp; We
suspect the whole thing is an attempt to gull the public into the
purchase of a book of inventions.&nbsp; If 7,000 were deducted
from the names of those to be inserted in the
&lsquo;Register,&rsquo; the number would still exceed, by many a
score, those who were actually &lsquo;married,&rsquo; as it is
called, by &lsquo;Robert Elliott, the Gretna Green
Parson.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor &ldquo;Parson&rdquo; could not stand this attack on
his veracity, and wrote a letter to the <i>Times</i>, which
appeared in its issue of 23 Feb., in which he does not deny the
bulk of the paragraph taken from the <i>Carlisle Journal</i>, but
gives his figures as to his matrimonial business: he says that in
the following years; he married so many couples:</p>

<p>He says he married 7,744 persons, but, either his arithmetic,

inaccuracy in the <i>Times</i> figures.</p>
<p>On 3 March arrived, in London, the first instalment of the
Chinese indemnity&mdash;&pound;1,000,000, all in silver.&nbsp; I
remember seeing the dock wagons guarded by soldiers, and
wondering, <!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>until told, what they
contained.&nbsp; Some more arrived on the 7th.</p>
<p>The Thames Tunnel was opened to the public on 25 March, with
as much ceremony as a private company could manage.&nbsp; There
were the Lord Mayor, the directors, and a host of scientific
persons, who solemnly went in procession down the staircase on
the Rotherhithe side, passed along the western archway of the
Tunnel, ascended and descended the staircase at Wapping, and
returned through the eastern archway.&nbsp; In the evening there
was a grand dinner at the &ldquo;London Tavern,&rdquo; where
&ldquo;Prosperity to the Thames Tunnel&rdquo; was drunk in some
wine which had been preserved from the commencement of the
enterprise, to celebrate its completion.</p>
<p>As with motor cars, so with aeronautics, the time of which I
write, was well in advance.&nbsp; We know of Sen. Santos
Dumont&rsquo;s performances with his motor balloon, in connection
with the Eiffel Tower, but Mr. Samuel Henson was before him in
applying mechanical power in aeronautics.&nbsp; He took out a
patent (No. 9,478), dated 29 Sep., 1842, for &ldquo;Apparatus and
machinery for conveying letters, goods and passengers, from place
to place through the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an aeroplane.&nbsp; The car which contained passengers,
engineer, engines, etc., was suspended in the centre of a
framework, which combined strength with lightness, covered with a
light, but close, woven fabric.&nbsp; It was started by
descending an inclined plane, the impetus from which caused it to
rise in the air, when the steam engine was put in action, to
continue its motion.&nbsp; The area of the sustaining surface was
some 4,500 square feet, and the weight to be borne by it,
including the carriage, etc., was estimated at 3,000lbs., which
was claimed to be considerably less per square foot than that of
many birds.</p>
<p>In April, 1843&mdash;but on what exact date I do not know, an
experimental voyage was made from the Hill of Dumbuck, near
Glasgow, by Professor Geolls.&nbsp; He successfully negotiated
the descent of the inclined plane, and rapidly rose in the air,
until he reached an altitude of nearly 3 miles.&nbsp; Feeling
giddy, he determined to descend to a mile and a half <!-- page
212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>above the earth.&nbsp; &ldquo;This I easily effected by
depressing the tail of the machine, which, up to this moment, I
had kept at an angle with the horizon of 9&frac34; degrees, to
that of 45.&nbsp; My course I had not varied since leaving the
hill; it was, per compass, south-west, and by west, half-west,
passing over Ayrshire, and in a direct line from Dumbuck to Ailsa
Craig, whither, indeed, I was tending, with the view of landing,
the latter being admirably suited for launching the machine in a
similar way to that adopted at Dumbuck, on my return home
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daylight had now broken, and the scene was most
gorgeous.&nbsp; I passed many ships; and, in particular, one
steamer, but whose paltry speed, in comparison with mine, was
nothing.&nbsp; Alas! however, this was not destined to last; for,
just as I had shot ahead of the steamer, something went wrong
with the machinery, and the fanners stopped.&nbsp; This did not
at all alarm me; for, as described by Mr. Henson, these fanners
are only necessary for propulsion, and not at all requisite for
maintaining the machine in the air.&nbsp; Unfortunately, however,
I perfectly forgot, in the hurry of the moment, to remove the
weights from the safety valve, and the effects from this were
disastrous in the extreme.&nbsp; The great accumulation of steam
that took place was too much for the pipes; and, consequently,
bang went three of them, at the same instant.&nbsp; The machine,
at this exact moment, feeling its equilibrium altered, surged
considerably, and the remaining pipes necessarily followed the
example of the others: fizz&mdash;bizz&mdash;whizz, away they
went, one after the other, like pop guns.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
one of these pipes, in flying off, struck a bamboo stretcher, and
shattered it so, that the machine, losing bearance on one side,
toppled over and became perfectly unmanageable; she, in fact,
whirled over and over in a way that may be imagined, but which it
is altogether impossible to describe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, of course, was now descending with fearful rapidity,
and nothing was left me to contemplate but death and
destruction.&nbsp; I can only compare my sensations at this
moment to those experienced in a nightmare, which, everyone
knows, are not <!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>the most agreeable in the
world.&nbsp; Sensibility now forsook me; and, indeed, this was
not to be wondered at, in consequence of the whirling of the
machine.&nbsp; On coming to my senses again, I found myself in
bed, with severe headache, nausea and vomiting, the usual
accompaniments of such a flight through the air; but, thanks to
Providence, I am now in a fair way of recovery, and willing to
perform the same feat again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luckily for the aeronaut, the accident was seen by the master
of a steamer, who sent a boat to his assistance, but the machine
was lost.</p>
<p>We often hear of &ldquo;treasure trove,&rdquo; but seldom find
the owner.&nbsp; However, here is a case: On 11 April, the
magistrate at Clerkenwell Police Court had a man named Benjamin
Thomas, and five other labourers, brought before him, under the
following circumstances.&nbsp; It seems they had been recently
engaged in grubbing up the roots of some trees in Tufnell Park,
Holloway, when they found, buried in the earth, two jars full of
sovereigns, supposed to have amounted to &pound;400.&nbsp; They
divided the money between them; but it was claimed by Mr. Henry
Tufnell, as Lord of the Manor; and all of them consented to give
up what they had, except Thomas, who said that his share was
&pound;51, but that he had spent, or lost it.&nbsp; The sum
recovered only amounted to &pound;231 17s.&nbsp; Thomas was
remanded for a few days, but, in the interval, a new claimant
appeared, in the person of Mr. Joseph Frost, of the firm of J.
and J. Frost, brass founders in Clerkenwell.&nbsp; It appeared
that, some time in August last year, in a temporary fit of mental
delusion, he had carried the money out at night, and buried
it.&nbsp; Mr. Tufnell waived his claim in favour of Mr. Frost,
and Thomas was committed for trial, on the charge of feloniously
appropriating the money to his own use.</p>
<p>A very curious accident happened to Brunel, the eminent
engineer.&nbsp; He was playing with the child of a friend,
pretending to swallow a half-sovereign, and bring it out at his
ear, when it slipped, and stuck in his trach&aelig;a, whence it
could not be disloged.&nbsp; This must have been in the latter
part of April, for it is mentioned in the <i>Times</i> of 28
April, as having occurred some short time previously.&nbsp; All
efforts of <!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>the surgeons could not reach the
coin, even though they constructed a machine which suspended him
by the heels, when he was shaken and thumped.&nbsp; On 27 April
Sir B. Brodie performed trach&aelig;otomy on the unfortunate
gentleman, but without avail; so they waited until he had
somewhat recovered, and again hung him up by his heels.&nbsp;
This was on 13 May, and, after a few gentle thumps, the
half-sovereign quitted its place, and dropped out of his mouth,
without causing him any pain or inconvenience.</p>
<p>In these days, millionaires, and multi-millionaires are
exceedingly common, but not so in the time of which I write, and
much astonishment was created at the sum of money which Mr.
Richard Arkwright, son of Sir Richard, the inventor of the
spinning jinny, left behind him.&nbsp; His will was proved, on 24
May, in Canterbury Prerogative Court, and his personal property
was sworn to exceed &pound;1,000,000; the stamp duty on the
probate of which was &pound;15,000, which was the highest duty
then payable, when the testator&rsquo;s personal estate was
&pound;1,000,000 or upwards.&nbsp; In this case the deceased left
behind him a fortune of nearly &pound;3,000,000.</p>
<p>The 18th of May is memorable in the Presbyterian Church of
Scotland, for the great secession of its members, and the
foundation of the Free Church.&nbsp; This was the day appointed
for the opening of the General Assembly, and Dr. Welsh, the
Moderator of the former Assembly, took the Chair.&nbsp; As soon
as business commenced, he read a protest from those who were
dissatisfied with the then state of the Church.&nbsp; It was a
very long document, and having read it, the Doctor, and those who
were of the same opinion, quietly left the Hall, forming a
procession and marching four abreast, to a Hall in Canon-mills,
where they elected Dr. Chalmers as their Moderator.</p>
<p>A contemporary account of this movement is given in the
<i>Observer</i> of 29 May: &ldquo;The number of clergymen who
have seceded from the Church of Scotland, is now 450; and it
cannot be a question that, by the middle of the week, the number
will be close on 500.&nbsp; This is nearly the half of the entire
clergy, the number being under 1,200.&nbsp; Among the <!-- page
215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>leaders will be found the name of almost every minister
distinguished for talent, moral worth, or weight of
character.&nbsp; Nearly the whole of the people have left the
Establishment with their ministers&mdash;so that the Free
Presbyterian Church, instituted by those who have left the
Establishment, may be considered the Church of Scotland.&nbsp;
The general impression in Scotland is, that the residuary church
cannot long exist.&nbsp; About &pound;240,000 have been raised in
less than ten weeks, for the erection of new churches, and for
the support of the seceding clergy; and there can be no question
that, in a few weeks, the amount will considerably exceed
&pound;300,000.&nbsp; Among the contributors, are the Marchioness
of Breadalbane, &pound;1,000; a Colonel in the Army, whose name
we do not remember, &pound;6,000, in three yearly instalments of
&pound;2,000; Mr. Henry Paul, a private gentleman, &pound;2,000;
Mr. Nisbet, bookseller, London, &pound;1,000; a Dissenter,
&pound;500; and there are various other subscriptions of
&pound;2,000 and &pound;1,000 each.&nbsp; Mr. Fox Maule is to
build and endow a church at his own expense; Mr. A. Campbell,
member for Argyleshire, is to do the same.&nbsp; In Elgin, the
pious and spirited inhabitants have raised &pound;1,000 to build
a church for the Rev. Alexander Topp, a young and popular
minister; and they will also liberally contribute to his
support.&nbsp; So that, in many instances, churches will be
built, and ministers be provided for, solely by private
munificence and local exertion, without requiring any aid from
the general fund.&nbsp; The General Assembly of the Establishment
is now sitting in Edinburgh, but its proceedings excite little
interest.&nbsp; The General Assembly of the Free Church, which
the people recognise as the Church of Scotland, is also sitting
in Edinburgh, and its proceedings excite an intensity of interest
hitherto unparalleled in the ecclesiastical history of
Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About this time there arose an objectionable class of men, who
tried to ape the gentleman, but could not, and they went by the
generic term of &ldquo;Gents.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Punch</i> was death
upon them, and I give one of the satirist&rsquo;s onslaughts, as
it reproduces the costumes and amusements of the day.&nbsp; First
let us see the <!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span

<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">AN ACT</p>
<p><i>For amending the Public Deportment of certain individuals
called</i> &ldquo;<i>Gents</i>,&rdquo; <i>abiding in London and
other places</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span> it having been represented
that there are, at present existing in the Metropolis, as well as
in the provincial districts, certain individuals known and spoken
of as &ldquo;Gents,&rdquo; whose bearing and manners are
perfectly at variance with the characters, which, from a
monomania, they appear desirous of assuming:</p>
<p><span class="smcap">And Whereas</span>, in consequence of
cheap clothes, imitative <!-- page 217--><a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>dispositions, and intellectual poverty, this class is
greatly on the increase, it has been thought necessary that this
Act should be framed to control their vicious habits:</p>
<p>May it, therefore, please your Majesty, that it be enacted:
<span class="smcap">And be it enacted</span> henceforth, that all
Gents, not actually in the employ of the <i>Morning Post</i>, or
Mr. Simpson, of the &ldquo;Albion,&rdquo; be prevented from
wearing white cravats at parties, the same being evidently an
attempt of sixth-rate individuals to ape the manners of
first-class circles.&nbsp; And that no Gent, who does not
actually keep a horse, and is not in the Army, be allowed to
strut up and down the Burlington Arcade, with a whip and
moustachios, such imposition being exceedingly offensive, and
amounting to a passive swindling of the spectators.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">And be it enacted</span>, that all such
things as light-blue stocks, large figured shawls, cheap primrose
gloves, white Chesterfield coal sacks, half-guinea Albert boots;
in fact, all those articles ticketed in the shop windows as
&ldquo;Gent&rsquo;s last style,&rdquo; be considered the
distinctive marks of the class, and condemned accordingly.&nbsp;
And that every individual, moreover, smoking outside an omnibus,
sticking large pins in his cravat, wearing fierce studs in his
shirt, walking with others four abreast in Regent Street, reading
slang publications, and adopting their language, playing
billiards in public rooms, sporting dingy white gloves in the
slips of the theatres, frequenting night taverns, and being on
terms of familiarity with the singers and waiters, thinking great
things of champagne, as if everything at a party depended upon
it; and, especially, wearing the hat on one side, be the signs of
most unmitigated Gents, and shunned equally with hydrophobia.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">And be it further enacted</span> that no
Gent be, in future, allowed to cross a hired horse with a view to
ten shillings worth of Sunday display in the Parks, the turnout
being always detected; nor shall be permitted to drive a gig, in
a fierce scarf, under similar circumstances.&nbsp; Nor shall any
Gent imagine that an acquaintance with all the questionable
resorts of London is &ldquo;knowing life&rdquo;; or that trousers
of large check pattern are anything but exceeding Gentish.</p>
<p><!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span><span class="smcap">Saving always</span> that the Gents
have not the sense to endeavour bettering their condition, which
is exceedingly probable; under which circumstances they had
better remain as they are, in ignorance of their melancholy
position.&nbsp; But, on the other hand, it is commanded that
people of common intellect, henceforth cease to designate any of
their male friends as &ldquo;Gents,&rdquo; the word being one of
exceedingly bad style, and equally objectionable with
&ldquo;genteel,&rdquo; which is, possibly, derived from it.&nbsp;
And that if, after this, anyone speaks of a &ldquo;Gent,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Party&rdquo; he knows, it is ordered that such speaker
be immediately set down as one of the unfortunate class in
question.</p>

<p>The Shakspere autograph which was sold on 24 May, 1841, came
again into the market, and was bought on 19 May, for &pound;145,
by the Corporation of the City of London.&nbsp; The <i>Patres
Conscripti</i> of the Common Council were not of one mind as to
the eligibility of the purchase.&nbsp; On the motion &ldquo;that
the Court agree to the report, and that the Chamberlain be
instructed to pay the sum,&rdquo; Mr. Warton rose to move, as an
amendment, that the report should lie upon the table.&nbsp; (A
laugh, and loud cries of &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;)&nbsp; He had,
he said, done all he could in the Committee, to prevail upon the
members that the purchase of the autograph was a most wasteful
and prodigal expenditure.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;)&nbsp; The precedent was a most mischievous
one.&nbsp; If the Court sanctioned such a proceeding as that
which the report had described, by and by the autographs of
archbishops and bishops, and other individuals who had, in times
long past, distinguished themselves, would supply apologies for
wasting the City cash, in order to gratify gentlemen who were
afflicted with that description of mania.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;
He hoped the Court would not catch the infection, but second his
rational effort to check it, by condemning the report to its
proper station on the table.&nbsp; After all, the document was
doubtful; but there was no doubt at all as to the profligacy of
the expenditure.&nbsp; (Laughter, and cries of &ldquo;Hear,
hear,&rdquo; and &ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;)&nbsp; Mr. Knott said it
was quite ridiculous to think for a <!-- page 219--><a

voting &pound;145 for a few doubtful, illegible, almost
obliterated scratches of a pen.&nbsp; (Laughter, and cries of
&ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;)&nbsp; He defied any man on earth to
say what those scratches represented.&nbsp; On a division there
were, for the motion 41; for the amendment 31.</p>

<p>The public exhibition of Cartoons for the frescoes for the new
Palace of Westminster, took place in Westminster Hall, on 3
July.&nbsp; There were 140 subjects altogether, varying in size
from 15ft. to 10ft. square, none being admitted over, or under
those standards.&nbsp; Prizes of &pound;300 each were awarded to
Armitage, Watts and Cope; of &pound;200 to Calcott, Bell and
Townsend; of &pound;100 to Frost, Harris, Selous, Bridges and
Severn; the judges being the Marquis of Lansdowne, Sir R. Peel
and Messrs. S. Rogers, Westmacott, Cook and Etty.&nbsp; The
Cartoons remained in Westminster Hall for 6 months; and, in Nov.
were removed to the Suffolk Street Gallery.&nbsp; They were
finally adjudicated upon by the Royal Commission of Fine Arts, on
12 July, 1844, the successful artists chosen to execute frescoes
were Cope, Horsley, Dyce, Maclise, Redgrave, and Cave Thomas.</p>
<p>The practice of duelling was fast dying out, and I give the
following case as being nearly one of the last, and one in which
the seconds and surgeon were tried for being accessory to
murder.&nbsp; Two brothers-in-law&mdash;Lt.-Col. Fawcett of the
55th Regiment and Lt. Munro of the Royal Horse
Guards&mdash;quarrelled, and on the morning of the 1st July
fought a duel with pistols in a field at the back of the
&ldquo;Brecknock Arms Tavern,&rdquo; in Camden Road.&nbsp;
Lt.-Col. Fawcett fell, mortally wounded, and died on the 3rd
July.&nbsp; The Coroner&rsquo;s jury found Lt. Munro, and the two
seconds, guilty of wilful murder, <!-- page 221--><a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>and the
surgeon as guilty in the second degree only, as it was believed
he was present only as medical attendant.&nbsp; Lieut. Munro and
his second got out of the way, but Lt-Col. Fawcett&rsquo;s second
and the surgeon were tried at the Central Criminal Court on 25
Aug.&nbsp; No evidence was tendered against the surgeon, and he
was at once discharged, and the jury found the second &ldquo;Not
Guilty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lt. Munro&rsquo;s second surrendered
himself, was tried on 14 Feb., 1844, and acquitted.&nbsp; Lieut.
Munro was cashiered from the Army for being absent without leave;
he afterwards surrendered, and was tried, 18 Aug., 1847, found
guilty, and sentenced to death; which sentence was commuted to 12
months&rsquo; imprisonment in Newgate.</p>
<p>The <i>Times</i> of 30 June, quoting the <i>Reading
Mercury</i>, has the following: &ldquo;<span class="smcap">A
Monster</span>.&mdash;A day or two since, a gentleman travelling
along the road near Colnbrook, had his attention attracted to the
screams of a child in the care of a tramping woman, who had with
her, two other children totally blind.&nbsp; The cries of the
child were so distressing, that he insisted on knowing the cause;
but; not getting a satisfactory answer, he forcibly removed a
bandage from its eyes, when, horrid to relate, he found these
encased with two small perforated shells, in which were two live
black beetles, for the purpose of destroying the sight.&nbsp; The
woman was instantly seized, and given into custody; and, at the
magistrate&rsquo;s meeting, at Eton, on Wednesday last, committed
for trial.&nbsp; There is too much reason to fear that the wretch
produced the blindness of the other two children, by similar
means.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was rendered into a street ballad.</p>
<p>A correspondent pointed out that it was well known to all who
pass through the parish of St. James&rsquo;s, at night, that the
district absolutely swarmed with gaming houses; there was, in
fact, no concealment about the matter, as the keepers vied with
each other in illuminating their doors and windows to attract the
notice of their victims.&nbsp; How was it that this disgrace was
permitted to exist from season to season?&nbsp; The police seemed
satisfied with the occasional conviction of one or more minor
delinquents from the neighbourhood of Leicester <!-- page
222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>Square, but the Leviathans in crime were allowed to
continue their nightly course of profligacy and plunder with
impunity.&nbsp; The French authorities, by a law which was
strictly enforced, entirely swept away this nuisance from their
capital, notoriously, for years, the very hotbed of the vice of
gaming; but we were lamentably behind our neighbours; for, while
we boasted of a Court pure in morals, and strict in the
performance of every religious duty, we allowed the Sabbath to be
desecrated, and the Palace of the Sovereign to be contaminated by
the close vicinage of houses expressly open for the practice of
this demoralising habit.&mdash;Are we much better now?</p>
<p>At the latter end of October, a new headdress for the infantry
was proposed, and Prince Albert was universally credited as being
its godfather&mdash;but public opinion was so unequivocally
expressed against it, that it was never likely to be
popular.&nbsp; It was neither soldier-like, nor appropriate, and
bore a strong resemblance to the old Hessian cap, which was
introduced into the German service.&nbsp; This headgear was
covered with black cloth, the crown and brim being of
black-varnished leather; the band was of white worsted, as was
the tuft, which was placed on a ball of red worsted.&nbsp;
Beneath this ball was a royal crown, underneath which was a
Maltese cross, in the centre of which was inscribed the number of
the regiment.</p>
<p><i>Punch</i> was especially severe upon the Albert
hat&mdash;and with the pictorial satire of &ldquo;Prince
Albert&rsquo;s Studio&rdquo; (by the way the hat is in no ways
exaggerated), is the following: &ldquo;Ever since the accession
of Prince Albert to the Royal Husband-ship of these realms, he
has devoted the energies of his mind, and the ingenuity of his
hands to the manufacture of Infantry caps, Cavalry trousers, and
Regulation sabretaches.&nbsp; One of his first measures was to
transmogrify the pantaloons of the Eleventh Hussars; and, as the
regiment alluded to is &ldquo;Prince Albert&rsquo;s Own,&rdquo;
His Royal Highness may do as he likes with his own, and no one
can complain of his bedizening the legs of the unfortunate
Eleventh, with scarlet cloth and gold door leather.&nbsp; When,
however, the Prince, throwing the whole <!-- page 223--><a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>of his
energies into a hat, proposed to encase the heads of the British
soldiery in a machine which seemed a decided cross between a
muff, a coal scuttle and a slop pail, then <i>Punch</i> was
compelled to interfere, for the honour of the British Army.&nbsp;
The result has been that the headgear has <!-- page 224--><a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>been
summarily withdrawn, by an order from the War Office, and the
manufacture of more of the Albert hat has been absolutely
prohibited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greatness of mind is shown in various ways by different
individuals.&nbsp; Hannibal was a great cutter out, for he cut a
passage through the Alps; but Prince Albert cuts out Hannibal,
inasmuch as His Royal Highness devotes his talent to the cutting
out of coats, and &lsquo;things inexpressible.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
Prince&rsquo;s studio could not fail to be an object of interest
to the <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span

have, therefore, at an enormous sacrifice of time and specie,
obtained a view of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the morning of Nov. 3, at 4 a.m., the raising of a portion
of the colossal statue of Nelson, on the pillar in Trafalgar
Square, commenced.&nbsp; This figure is 17 feet high from its
base to the top of the hat, and is made of stone from the Granton
quarry, belonging to the Duke of Buccleugh.&nbsp; It weighs
nearly 18 tons, and, needless to say, is made in segments.&nbsp;
These were put together before it was raised, to show the
public&mdash;and during the two days it was on view, it was
visited by 100,000 persons.</p>
<p>The building this column had seemed slow, but that was nothing
compared to its completion; the bas reliefs were long in being
placed, and it was not till 31 Jan., 1867, that Landseer&rsquo;s
four couchant lions were exposed to public gaze.&nbsp; Of the
progress of its building, <i>Punch</i> (25 Nov., 1843) has some
very fine fooling.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;THE NELSON COLUMN DRAMA.</p>
<p>The earliest announcement of the late Covent Garden
management, was a piece entitled &lsquo;Trafalgar Square, or the
Nelson Monument.&rsquo;&nbsp; We have obtained the following
slight information respecting it.&nbsp; The drama is described as
&lsquo;a grand architectural and historical burletta,&rsquo; in
two acts; and the prologue was to have been spoken by Mr.
Widdicomb, as <i>Time</i>.&nbsp; The two acts comprise the
commencement and completion, and a lapse of twenty years is
supposed to take place between them, in which time &lsquo;the
boy,&rsquo; who is the principal character, becomes a middle-aged
man.&nbsp; The following speech is very fine.&nbsp; The boy
enquires of the mason when the column will be finished, who
replies, in an interval of the steak banquet, which they are
enjoying together:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Mason</i>.&mdash;I&rsquo;ve asked that fearful
question of the stars,<br />
Who wink responding&mdash;of the Board of Works,<br />
Whose works have bored us&mdash;of the misty moon,<br />
Towards whose lodgings, after years of toil,<br />
We rise no nearer.&nbsp; All were still, but now,<br />
Whilst gazing on that steak of beef,<br />
<!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

And cheer us in our lonely solitude,<br />

&rsquo;Twill rise, like College honours, by degrees,<br />
And to our limbs a pillar be, of ease:<br />
Our hearts are warm&mdash;although upon the frieze.</p>

<p>The following duet is also introduced by the man and the boy
in the second act:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nor the subsequent July.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very early in November, a War Office circular (dated 31 Oct.)
was issued, to regulate and establish regimental savings banks,
which have done so much to encourage thrift among our
soldiers.&nbsp; The maximum of each soldier&rsquo;s deposit was
<!-- page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>limited to &pound;30 in any one year, and to &pound;200
in the whole.&nbsp; The rate of interest on deposits was fixed at
&pound;3 15 s. per cent per annum, but no interest was to be
allowed upon less than 6s. 8d. and 13s. 4d., nor upon any sums
that had not remained on deposit for at least one month, to be
reckoned from the last monthly muster day.</p>
<p>In the <i>Times</i> of 10 Nov. is the following: &ldquo;A
rather amusing scene took place in Cheapside, yesterday, shortly
before the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s procession to Westminster.&nbsp;
Whilst the streets were blocked up against the passage of
vehicles and horses, one of those sharp little urchins, known by
the generic title of the &lsquo;twopenny cavalry,&rsquo; who
rattle through the streets with Her Majesty&rsquo;s suburban
mails, was stopped, opposite Bow Church, by a party of police,
who told him they acted under the orders of the Lord Mayor.&nbsp;
The post-boy, with all the dignity of Her Majesty&rsquo;s
representative, assuming an air of great condescension, assured
the police that he had the highest possible respect for the Lord
Mayor, but, being express upon Her Majesty&rsquo;s business, he
was determined to proceed.&nbsp; The police persisted in stopping
him, a crowd collected, and it was clear their sympathies sided
with the post-boy, who carried himself, throughout the
controversy, with great courage, calmness, and
self-possession.&nbsp; The police had, by this time, seized the
bridle, whilst the boy endeavoured to force his way forward,
backed by the strenuous exertions of his steed, who also appeared
as if inspired by the authority of a Royal Commission.&nbsp; The
post-boy, finding physical force insufficient, tried what
authority would do, and threatened them with the vengeance of the
Home Secretary, for attempting to stop Her Majesty&rsquo;s
mails.&nbsp; This had the desired effect of bringing the police
to a parley; and, as the post-boy was backed by popular applause,
he gained momentarily in the discussion, but did not complete his
advantage until he took out a memorandum book, and began, coolly,
to note down the numbers of the constables.&nbsp; This stroke was
decisive; they, at once, capitulated, merely stipulating that
they should have his address in return.&nbsp; To this, he readily
assented, and searched diligently for his cardcase, but that mark
of gentility <!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>was not at hand.&nbsp; He, however,
made a page from his memorandum book serve his purpose, and took
his leave amid the loud congratulations of the applauding crowd,
with the following pithy address to the constables: &lsquo;I
can&rsquo;t well see what use you are.&nbsp; A hundred years ago
there were no police, and Lord Mayor&rsquo;s shows went off
better than they do now.&nbsp; For my part, I can&rsquo;t see
what you do here at all, for you know&rsquo;&mdash;he added with
a significant grin&mdash;&lsquo;you know you don&rsquo;t look so
very well in a procession.&rsquo;&nbsp; Shouts of laughter
followed the post-boy&rsquo;s brief speech, as he rode on
triumphantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was about this time that M. Louis Antoine Jullien, to whom
we owe so much for the popularisation of good music, and for the
improvement of our orchestras, came into notoriety as a caterer
for the public&rsquo;s amusement, and for his promenade
concerts.&nbsp; These had been popular in the open air at
Vauxhall, Ranelagh, Marylebone, and other public gardens; but the
first, under cover, was given in 1838 at the Lyceum Theatre, or,
as it was then called, The English Opera House, when the pit was
boarded over, and an orchestra erected on the stage exactly as we
are now so familiar with.&nbsp; Jullien, in 1838, had been
unlucky in Paris, was bankrupt, and came to London, where, in
1840, he was assistant to Eliason, the violinist and conductor of
an orchestra of 100 performers, and a small chorus.&nbsp; Next
year Jullien was the conductor; and, in 1842, on 2 Dec., he
started for himself, at the English Opera House, the series of
promenade concerts with which his name will always be
associated.</p>
<p>He always would have the very best musicians that he could
find for his orchestra, and in this year (1843) among them were
Barrett, Baumann, Harper, K&oelig;nig, Richardson, Hill, Lazarus,
Patey, Howell and Jarrett, and in after years he had such,
soloists as Ernst, Sivori, Bottesini Wieniawski and
Sainton.&nbsp; In 1857 he came, financially, to grief; he then
went to Paris, was imprisoned for debt in Clichy, in 1859, and
died in a lunatic asylum on 14 March, 1860.</p>

</a></p>
<p>In his later years he became much stouter than he is here
represented, and, as a conductor, posed a great deal too
much.&nbsp; <!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>Those of my readers who recollect
him will acknowledge the truth of the following description of
him, when conducting his British Army Quadrilles, taken from his
biography in <i>Grove&rsquo;s History of Music and Musicians</i>:
&ldquo;With coat thrown widely open, white waistcoat, elaborately
embroidered shirt front, wristbands of extravagant length, turned
back over his cuffs, a wealth of black hair, and a black
moustache&mdash;itself a striking novelty&mdash;he wielded his
baton, encouraged his forces, repressed the turbulence of his
audience with indescribable gravity and magnificence, went
through all the pantomime of the British Army or Navy Quadrilles,
seized a violin or a piccolo at the moment of climax, and, at
last, sunk exhausted into his gorgeous velvet chair.&nbsp; All
pieces of Beethoven&rsquo;s were conducted with a jewelled baton,
and in <!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>a pair of clean kid gloves, handed
him, at the moment, on a silver salver.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Prince Albert took a great interest in Agriculture, and his
Flemish Farm at Windsor was a model; but it was hard to make the
average Englishman believe that a foreigner could ever do any
good as a Farmer, and John Leech drew a fancy portrait of the
prince in <i>Punch</i>, 25 Nov., where it illustrates a portion
of a speech of Sir Robert Peel at Tamworth: &ldquo;Prince Albert
has turned his attention to the promotion of agriculture; and, if
you have seen, as most probably you have, an account of the sale
of Prince Albert&rsquo;s stock, and the price they fetched, I
have not the slightest doubt you will give one cheer more to
Prince Albert, as a British Farmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the beginning of December the bronze equestrian statue <!--
page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>of George IV. was set up on a pedestal at the
north-east corner of Trafalgar Square.&nbsp; It is the work of
Chantrey, and was intended to be mounted on the Marble Arch,
which was, originally, the gateway to Buckingham Palace, until
its removal to Cumberland Gate, Hyde Park, in 1851.</p>
<p>In the very early part of December, some of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s subjects, Canadian Indians, from the
north-eastern shores of Lake Huron, came to visit England.&nbsp;
They were of the Ojibbeway tribe, and were nine in number, two
old chiefs, four warriors, two women, and a little girl, 10 years
old.&nbsp; On the 20 Dec. they were presented to the Queen at
Windsor, and received from Her Majesty a cheque for &pound;20,
and a quantity of gorgeous plaid, with which to astonish the
other natives, on their return.&nbsp; They afterwards exhibited
themselves, danced war dances, etc., at the Egyptian Hall, at an
admission fee of half-a-crown.</p>

Daniel O&rsquo;Connell&mdash;General Tom Thumb&mdash;His visit to
the Queen&mdash;The Polka&mdash;How to dance
it&mdash;&ldquo;Jullien&rsquo;s Grand Polka.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Times</i> of 19 Jan. copies the following from the
<i>Worcester Chronicle</i>: &ldquo;<span class="smcap">A Child
for Sale</span>.&mdash;The following extraordinary letter was
received, a short time ago, by a gentleman in the neighbourhood
of Tewkesbury, from a person residing here.&nbsp; The letter is
dated from a certain court in this town, but we omit the precise
locality, and the writer&rsquo;s name, hoping that, without
pursuing the exposure to that extent, it will be sufficient to
teach him that natural affection is not to be made a matter of
bargain and sale, and that it is the duty of a parent himself to
cherish the child which he has been the means of bringing into
the world:&mdash;&lsquo;Sir,&mdash;Having heard that you
expressed a wish to have a child and did not mind giving a sum of
money as an inducement i flatter myself that I have it in my
power to furnish you with one to answer your purpose in every
respect it is a boy 2 years old a good looking healthy spirited
child and sound in wind and limb and that you can rair him up to
suit your inclination you can send word by the bearer and appoint
any time to inspect the child.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With every wish, in this book of Gossip, to steer as clear of
politics as possible, yet it would belie its name were the famous
trial of Daniel O&rsquo;Connell not to be mentioned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Repeal of the Union&rdquo; was his watchword and perpetual
cry, and with it he stirred up the Irish people to a pitch when
he found it difficult to manage and restrain them.&nbsp; On 16
March, 1843, was held at Trim the first of great public meetings
which he designed, but did not carry out; and on 15 Aug. was a
monster meeting on the Hill of Tara; but <!-- page 233--><a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>the one to
be held at Clontarf on 8 Oct. was to have eclipsed its
predecessors.&nbsp; But this was forbidden by the Government,
and, a week later, warrants were issued for the arrest of
O&rsquo;Connell, his son John, and his chief colleagues, on a
charge of conspiring to create discontent and disaffection among
the liege subjects of the Queen, and with contriving, &ldquo;by
means of intimidation, and the demonstration of great physical
force, to procure and effect changes to be made in the
government, laws, and constitution of this realm.&rdquo;&nbsp;
O&rsquo;Connell was allowed bail, but on 8 Nov. a true bill was
found by the jury, yet the trial did not take place till the 15th
Jan. of this year.&nbsp; On the 12th Feb., the jury returned a
verdict of guilty of unlawful and seditious conspiracy, but
judgment was not delivered till 30 May, when he was sentenced to
imprisonment for twelve months, a fine of &pound;2,000, and to
find surety to keep the peace for seven years.&nbsp; He had to go
to prison, where he was well treated and allowed to see his
friends; his sentence was appealed against, and reversed in the
House of Lords, on 4 Sep., 1844, when he was instantly
liberated.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p233b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>During all this time there was great excitement, people
wearing Repeal buttons, one of which is here delineated, and
other emblems, while the uncrowned King of Ireland was presented,
at Mullaghmast, with a velvet cap surmounted with shamrocks, and
having a green tassel; the cap, in fact, with which readers of
<i>Punch</i> are so familiar.</p>
<p>Of course, his release from prison was an occasion to be made
the most of.&nbsp; An amphitheatrical triumphal car was provided,
and, upon it, were mounted O&rsquo;Connell, his son, and the Rev.
Dr. Miley, and this gimcrack piece of property was drawn by six
horses ridden by postillions.&nbsp; The following is an account
by an eye witness:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>&ldquo;The ovation commenced at two
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; First came the trades of Dublin, each
preceded by the banner of its body, and a band playing such music
as only temperance bands can play, and, generally, with much
discrimination, selecting rather difficult pieces for their
performance, and eschewing all national airs.&nbsp; The banners
were usually displayed from coaches, intended to hold four, but
contriving to allow from sixteen to eighteen to fit into, and
hang on by them.&nbsp; Thus they came on: Bricklayers (with a
painting of the Bank of Ireland, and the superscription of
&lsquo;Our Old House at Home&rsquo;); slaters, woollen operatives
(in a small open car); nailors (with a picture of Brian Boroihme
&lsquo;nailing&rsquo; the Danes at Clontarf); coach makers,
tailors (with a very gorgeous equipage, six horses, postillions
and outriders); tinplate workers, displaying as their sign, a man
with a tin helmet on his head, and a dish cover of the same metal
on his arm&mdash;otherwise unassumingly attired in a blue coat
and white trousers; and other bodies of tradesmen too numerous to
mention, with their appropriate emblems and banners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Next came a number of Repeal wardens,
bearing wands, and occupying respectable-looking coaches and
carriages.&nbsp; After them drove the committee of the political
trades&rsquo; unions; the members of it attired in green sashes
and scarves, and bearing wands with green flags in their
hands.&nbsp; Next in order were the various members of the
Corporation, aldermen, town councillors, and officers, dressed in
their robes of office and <!-- page 235--><a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>cocked
hats, glittering with chains, and furred from head to foot.&nbsp;
The majority of these gentlemen were in their own carriages, into
each of which were packed as many of the owner&rsquo;s friends as
could find standing room, several private vehicles being mixed up
through the order of procession.&nbsp; Then came the private
carriages of the Lord Mayor, who was in full dress; and then,
preceded by a confused mass of wand bearers, the triumphal
chariot itself, surrounded by a mob so dense that it was with
great difficulty that the six splendid dappled greys could force
the cumbrous vehicle along, which, every instant, seemed to
become a second Car of Juggernaut, and crush some of its
adorers.&nbsp; More vehicles, a few horsemen, multitudes of hack
cars and pedestrians, a tail of old women and little boys,
followed; and so the monster procession, after winding its slow
length along through the greater part of Dublin, and causing a
total cessation of business in the line of its progress,
terminated.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In February appeared, in London, at the Princess&rsquo;s
Theatre, &ldquo;General Tom Thumb,&rdquo; the most popular of
modern dwarfs&mdash;thanks to the advertising qualities of his
exhibitor, P. T. Barnum.&nbsp; The real name of this mite was
Charles S. Stratton, and he was said to have been born on 11
Jan., 1832, but this, as with all data connected with him, must
be accepted with caution.&nbsp; It was said of him, that, at his
birth, he weighed 9 lbs. 2 oz., somewhat more than the average
weight of a newly born infant.&nbsp; At about 5 months old, he
weighed 15 lbs., and measured 25 inches in height; since which
time he never increased in stature; and, at the time of his
arrival in England, he weighed but 15 lbs. 2 oz.&nbsp; He had,
previously, been exhibited in New York and the principal cities
of America, where his miniature palace, furniture and equipage
excited considerable curiosity.&nbsp; When he embarked from New
York for England, he was escorted to the packet by not less than
10,000 persons.</p>
<p>On 1 April, he appeared, by command, before Her Majesty at
Buckingham Palace, when the Queen presented him, <i>with her own
hand</i>, with &ldquo;a superb souvenir, of the most exquisite
<!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>handicraft, manufactured of mother of pearl, and
mounted with gold and precious stones.&nbsp; On one side are the
crown and Royal initials, V.R., and, on the reverse, bouquets of
flowers in enamel and rubies.&nbsp; In addition to this splendid
gift, Her Majesty subsequently presented the General with a
beautiful gold pencil case, with the initials of Tom Thumb, and
his coat of arms, engraved on the emerald surmounting the
case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anent this, <i>Punch</i> is exceedingly satirical: &ldquo;Her
Majesty has again commanded &lsquo;the performances of <i>Tom
Thumb</i>, the Yankee Dwarf.&rsquo;&nbsp; This, indeed, was to
have been expected.&nbsp; We have only to reflect upon the
countless acts of patronage towards the Arts and
Sciences&mdash;had only to remember a few of the numerous
personal condescensions of the Queen towards men of letters,
artists and philosophers&mdash;to be assured that even <span
class="smcap">Tom Thumb</span> would be welcomed with that
graceful cordiality which has, heretofore, made Buckingham Palace
and Windsor Castle the homes of Poetry and Science.&nbsp; <i>De
minimis curat Regina</i>!&nbsp; Continental monarchs stop short
in <!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>their Royal favours at full-grown authors and artists;
but the enthusiasm of Her Majesty <span class="smcap">Queen
Victoria</span>, not content with showering all sorts of favours
and rewards upon the literary and artistic spirits of her own
country and age, lavishes, with prodigal hand, most delicate
honours upon an American <span class="smcap">Tom Thumb</span>,
whose astounding genius it is, to measure, in his boots,
five-and-twenty inches!&nbsp; To this, how small is <span
class="smcap">Victor Hugo</span> at the Tuileries; to this, how
mean and petty G&ouml;the at the Court of Saxe-Weimar!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Tom Thumb</span>
being&mdash;according to the biography published by his showman,
<span class="smcap">Barnum</span>&mdash;the son of a Yankee
carpenter, we should much like to know the General&rsquo;s
arms.&nbsp; Did Her Majesty, before the
&lsquo;performance,&rsquo; send to learn them, that they might be
duly engraved? or were they, as <span
class="smcap">Mathew&rsquo;s</span> French Shoemaker made his
little boot, struck off in &lsquo;a moment of
enthusiasm&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>About this time came to us &ldquo;that sweet boon,&rdquo;
<span class="smcap">the Polka</span>.&nbsp; Originally a Bohemian
Peasant dance, it was imported into fashionable saloons of Berlin
and St. Petersburg.&nbsp; It was, at this time, the rage in
Paris, as the <i>Times</i> observes: &ldquo;The Paris papers are
destitute of news.&nbsp; Our private letters state that
&lsquo;politics are, for the moment, suspended in public regard,
by the new and all-absorbing pursuit&mdash;the Polka&mdash;a
dance recently imported from Bohemia, and which embraces in its
qualities the intimacy of the waltz, with the vivacity of the
Irish jig.&nbsp; You may conceive how completely is &lsquo;the
Polka&rsquo; the rage, from the fact that the lady of a
celebrated ex-minister, desiring to figure in it at a
<i>soir&eacute;e dansante</i>, monopolised the professor, <i>par
excellence</i>, of that <i>specialit&eacute;</i> for three hours,
on Wednesday morning last, at 200 francs the
hour.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On its first importation into England, it was used as a
<i>ballet</i>, on the stage, with very fancy Bohemian costume, as
we may see in the three following illustrations of Mdlle.
Carlotta Grisi and M. Perrot, dancing their idea of it at Her
Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre in 1844.</p>

239</span>But it soon became a Drawing-room dance, and it is
edifying to know exactly how it was danced then.&nbsp; It was
found too elaborate, and the number of steps had to be reduced in
quantity, and curtailed in quality.&nbsp; But this is the dance
as given in the <i>Illustrated London News</i> of 11 May:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;THE DRAWING-ROOM POLKA.</p>
<p>We are much gratified in being enabled to lay before our
readers an accurate description of the <i>v&eacute;ritable</i>,
or <i>Drawing-room Polka</i>, as danced at Almack&rsquo;s, and at
the halls of the nobility and gentry of this country.</p>
<p><i>La Polka</i> having appeared amongst us under so many
different guises, we determined to spare no pains to procure a
true description of its <i>danse</i>; for which we are indebted
to Mrs. James Rae, who has been fortunate enough to secure the
details from M. Coralli, fils, the instructor of the young
noblemen and gentry in Paris.</p>
<p><i>La Polka</i>, like its predecessors, the waltz and galop,
is a <i>danse &agrave; deux</i>, couples following each other in
the <i>salle de danse</i>, commencing at pleasure, and adopting,
of the following figures, that which pleases them most at the
moment.&nbsp; All those anxious to shine in <i>La Polka</i>, will
dance the whole of them, returning from time to time, by way of
rest, to the first figure.</p>
<p><i>The measure</i>, or time, is 2&ndash;4; but, to facilitate
our definition, we subdivide each measure, or bar, into
one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four; the accent on the two,
etc., to be played not so fast as the galop.</p>
<p><i>The steps</i> are two, and the following description may,
in some measure, convey them to our readers; we commence with the
first, and most general.&nbsp; At the one, hop on the right leg,
lifting, or doubling up your left leg at the same moment; at the
two, put your left leg boldly forward on the ground; at the
three, bring your right toe up to your left heel; at the four,
advance your left foot a short step forward: now, at the one, in
the next measure, or bar of the time, hop on the left leg,
doubling, or lifting up your right leg, and <!-- page 240--><a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>so on,
proceeding in this step, with your arm encircling your
partner&rsquo;s waist, round the room.&nbsp; This may be termed
the first figure.</p>
<p>Figure 2.&mdash;Still adopting the same step, with your right
arm round your partner&rsquo;s waist, and her right hand in your
left, you place your lady exactly before you, and back all round
the room, your lady pursuing you (as shown in the sketch); you
then reverse this figure, and let your partner do the back step,
whilst you pursue her, and, at the same time, carefully guide her
round the room.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>In backing, the leg which in figure one, you put boldly
forward on the ground, you now fling boldly backward, and are
thus enabled to effect your progress round the room.</p>
<p>Figure 3.&mdash;With the same step you waltz round the
room&mdash;in other words, you perform the Galop waltz,
substituting the Polka step as described.</p>
<p><!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>Figure 4.&mdash;This is also a waltz with the second
step, which we will now describe as &ldquo;the Heel and Toe
step.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the one, make a little hop on your
right leg, dropping your left heel close to your right foot; at
the two, another little hop on the right leg, pointing your left
toe (not forward, but as close to your right foot as possible);
at the tree, another little hop on the right leg, advancing one
step forward with the left foot; at the four, bring up the right
foot, turning at the same instant, and passing your partner over
to your left arm from your right arm; in your next measure,
return your lady to your left arm, and so on.</p>

<p>Figure 5.&mdash;This is termed the back waltz.&nbsp; The step
adopted in it by yourself and partner, is the back step described
in figure two, and you turn in this waltz exactly the contrary
way to that in which you turn in all other waltzes&mdash;hence

have just described, there is a short introduction (of which we
give a sketch), consisting of four measures, danced thus; leading
your partner from her seat, and giving her her place in the
circle, and placing themselves <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>, you take
her left hand in your right, and make the first step four
times&mdash;first forward, then backward, forward again, and then
backward, taking care to gain ground in the forward steps; you
then start with the first figure.</p>

<p>There was a furore about the Polka; not only in dancing it,
but there was an absolute mania for naming articles of dress
after it.&nbsp; Ladies wore Polka hats, Polka jackets and Polka
boots, and men had Polka ties.&nbsp; Jullien published a new
Polka about every fortnight, and the whole people were Polka
mad.&nbsp; Here is a street ballad on the subject:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 243--><a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Jullien&rsquo;s Grand
Polka</span>.</p>
<p>Oh! sure the world is all run mad,<br />
The lean, the fat, the gay, the sad&mdash;<br />
All swear such pleasure they never had,<br />
Till they did learn the Polka.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Chorus</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First cock up your right leg&mdash;so,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Balance on your left great toe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stamp your heels, and off you go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Original Polka.&nbsp; Oh!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Mrs. Tibbs, the tailor&rsquo;s wife,<br />
With Mother Briggs is sore at strife,<br />
As if the first and last of life<br />
Was but to learn the Polka.</p>
<p>Quadrilles and waltzes all give way,<br />
For Jullien&rsquo;s Polkas bear the sway,<br />
The chimney sweeps, on first of May,<br />
Do, in London, dance the Polka.</p>
<p>If a pretty girl you chance to meet,<br />
With sparkling eyes and rosy cheek,<br />
She&rsquo;ll say, young man, we&rsquo;ll have a treat,<br />
If you can dance the Polka.</p>
<p>A lady who lives in this town,<br />
Went and bought a Polka gown,<br />
And for the same she gave five pound,<br />
All for to dance the Polka.</p>
<p>But, going to the Ball one night,<br />
On the way she got a dreadful fright,<br />
She tumbled down and ruined quite<br />
The gown to dance the Polka.</p>
<p>A Frenchman has arrived from France,<br />
To teach the English how to dance,<br />
And fill his pocket&mdash;&ldquo;what a chance&rdquo;&mdash;<br
/>
By gammoning the Polka.</p>
<p>Professors swarm in every street,<br />
&rsquo;Tis ground on barrel organs sweet;<br />
And every friend you chance to meet<br />
Asks, if you dance the Polka.</p>
<p><!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Brilliant with trans-Atlantic fame;<br />
Says she, I&rsquo;m German by my name,<br />
So best I know the Polka.</p>
<p>And the row de dow she danced,<br />
And in short clothes and red heels pranced,<br />
And, as she skipped, her red heels glanced<br />
In the Bohemian Polka.</p>
<p>But, now, my song is near its close,<br />
A secret, now, I will disclose,<br />
Don&rsquo;t tell, for it&rsquo;s beneath the rose,<br />
A humbug is the Polka.</p>
<p>Then heigh for humbug France or Spain,<br />
Who brings back our old steps again,<br />
Which John Bull will applaud amain,<br />
Just as he does the Polka.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm">An English dinner&mdash;Consols at

frauds&mdash;Royal visitors&mdash;Opening letters by
Government&mdash;Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s Statue&mdash;Barry on
the Thames&mdash;Visit of Louis Philippe&mdash;Guano&mdash;Queen
opens Royal Exchange&mdash;Lord Mayor hissed.</p>
<p>As the length of time between this date, and the present
writing is great, and our social habits have somewhat changed, it
may be interesting to some of my readers to hear a
Frenchman&rsquo;s account of an upper-class dinner.&nbsp; It is
taken from the <i>Constitutionel</i>, the organ of M. Thiers:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Madeira wine has been out of fashion, in
England, for some time.&nbsp; Sherry and Port (to which are
occasionally added Bordeaux and Champagne, Rhenish wines and
Hermitage) are, now, the only wines to be seen on the tables of
the rich.&nbsp; As for beer (the national drink), it only makes
its appearance at a banquet, for remembrance sake, and in very
small quantity.&nbsp; Port wine is held in especial favour by the
English, because, while it is more impregnated with alcohol than
any other, it is, at the same time the least irritating, and
facilitates, more than all the rest, the important operations of
the digestive organs.&nbsp; In order, however, to be possessed of
all the requisite qualities, it must not only be of the finest
growth, or have been eight or nine years in the cellar, but the
regular connoisseurs insist that it must cross the line several
times, in order to be first-rate.&nbsp; Five or six servants,
with powdered wigs, in silk stockings and knee breeches, hover
about the table.&nbsp; The covers are always changed at every
successive course, and there is no fear of eating off the dirty
plate of one&rsquo;s neighbour, or using his knife or fork, the
<!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>sideboard being laden with piles of plates and
conveniences of every description.&nbsp; After fish, which always
constitutes the first course, the host invites one of his guests
to drink a glass of wine with him, desiring him to help himself
to that which he likes best.&nbsp; You take that which is offered
you.&nbsp; Your host then pours out a glass for himself, and
sends you the bottle by a servant.&nbsp; You fill your glass, you
raise it to your lips with a half bow, and drink as much of it as
you feel inclined.&nbsp; The same ceremony is repeated among the
other guests.&nbsp; It should be mentioned that, if you ask a
lady to take wine, you always fill her glass before your own;
but, if you invite a gentleman so to do, you never fail to help
yourself first.&nbsp; This custom was, formerly, very
inconvenient to strangers, it being, then, absolutely necessary
to empty one&rsquo;s glass; at present, you need only drink a
portion, and ladies may satisfy the rules of etiquette by merely
moistening their lips.&nbsp; After fish, come roast meats, boiled
vegetables, and various delicate sauces, with which you make your
<i>cuisine</i> upon your own plate; puddings and game of all
sorts follow, amongst which there is, always, to begin with, one
dish, especially appropriate to the season.&nbsp; It is to the
former article of diet (puddings), that English children are
indebted, it is said, for their excellent health, and their
magnificent rosy complexions.&nbsp; The cloth is at length
removed, and the mahogany table shines forth in all its
splendour.&nbsp; Dessert follows, consisting of a few sweetmeats,
or <i>confitures</i>, but abounding in fruits from all five parts
of the world, and the produce of all the four seasons, and
including superb pineapples, Portugal grapes, almonds, red nuts
of a delicious flavour, dates, figs, rich juicy oranges, etc.,
etc.&nbsp; The wine is brought on in glass decanters, ticketed
and placed in silver stands.&nbsp; These stands glide along the
shining table, which is as smooth as ice, in the midst of silver,
or crystal vases filled with fruit, etc.&nbsp; The host, after
helping himself to wine, pushes about the whole
&lsquo;battery&rsquo; of decanters, which, going the round of the
table, soon regain their original situation.&nbsp; A quarter of
an hour elapses, when the mistress of the house rises and
retires, followed by all the ladies.&nbsp; It is then that <!--
page 247--><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>the <i>s&eacute;ance de vin</i> begins.&nbsp; The
subject of conversation soon changes, and political questions are
discussed.&nbsp; The conversation, without getting stormy,
acquires that degree of warmth and animation, which a good
dinner, when one is blessed with a strong head and a good
digestion, generally inspires.&nbsp; Hard drinking has, generally
speaking, fallen into desuetude.&nbsp; It is only foxhunters and
country gentlemen who remain faithful, nowadays, to that ignoble
custom.&nbsp; A gentleman who has any self-respect, never so far
forgets himself as to get tipsy, for he would certainly be looked
upon with an evil eye, by the company, if he were to enter the
drawing-room with an indistinct articulation, or with trembling
legs.&nbsp; Dinner is over about half-past nine.&nbsp; The
gentlemen then rejoin the ladies to take tea and coffee, and the
conversation turns, as before, upon the news of the
day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 8 April, Consols rose to par, or &pound;100 for &pound;100
stock, for the first time for nearly a century.&nbsp; The last
time they were at &pound;100 was in 1749, the year after the
peace of Aix la Chapelle; at which period the public debt was
rather more than &pound;78,000,000.&nbsp; The highest price the
Three per Cents, ever rose to, previously, was in June, 1737, and
again, in May, 1739, when they attained the high price of
&pound;107.&nbsp; In September, 1797, they fell to 47&#8540;,
which is the lowest price to which they have ever fallen.</p>
<p>On 23 May, the Derby was won by a horse called <i>Running
Rein</i>, which was the occasion of an Action in the Court of
Exchequer, on 1 July, before Baron Alderson.&nbsp; It was alleged
that the horse had not been truly described, that he was not of
the age which qualified him to run for the Derby, and that he
ought not, therefore, to be deemed the winner of the race.&nbsp;
Colonel Peel, the owner of Orlando, the second horse, claimed the
stakes, on the ground that Running Rein was not the horse
represented; and Mr. Wood, the owner of Running Rein, brought
this action against the Colonel.</p>
<p>Mr. Cockburn, who conducted the plaintiff&rsquo;s case, gave
the pedigree of Running Rein, and his whole history.&nbsp; Among
other things, Mr. Cockburn mentioned that, in October, 1843, <!--
page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>Running Rein won a race at Newmarket; that he was
objected to on the score of age; but, eventually, the stewards
had decided in his favour.&nbsp; The horse was, originally, the
property of Mr. Goodman; and, Mr. Cockburn said, it was because
suspicion attached to some transactions of Goodman, and because
certain persons had betted heavily against Running Rein, that
opposition was raised against Mr. Wood receiving the
stakes.&nbsp; He made a severe attack on Lord George Bentinck,
who, he asserted, was the real party in the cause.&nbsp;
Witnesses for the plaintiff described the horse at various
periods of its career; it was of a bay colour, with black legs,
and a little white on the forehead; its heels were cracked, and,
in 1842, it broke the skin on one leg, which left a scar.&nbsp;
George Hitchcock, a breaker of colts, employed to break Running
Rein in October, 1842, was cross-examined to this effect:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I know George Dockeray, the trainer.&nbsp;
I never said to him, &lsquo;Damn it, this colt has been broken
before; here is the mark of the pad on his back.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
showed him the mark, but I never said those words, or any words
to that effect.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why I showed him the
mark.&nbsp; It was not big enough for the mark of a pad, and it
was not the place for the saddle to make it.&nbsp; I told Lord
George Bentinck the same.&nbsp; The mark of the pad never wears
out.&nbsp; I recollect being asked, in the presence of Mr. Smith,
what I had there? and I recollect answering, a
four-year-old.&nbsp; I have not the slightest doubt of it.&nbsp;
Mr. Smith struck me for it.&nbsp; I did not say, afterwards, that
I had forgotten all about the horsewhipping, and that the marks
of the pad had worn out.&nbsp; I never said, either, that
somebody had behaved very well to me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At an early period of the examination of witnesses, Mr. Baron
Alderson expressed a wish that he and the jury should see the
horse; and Mr. Cockburn said he had no objection.&nbsp; On the
cross-examination of William Smith, a training groom residing at
Epsom, it came out that the horse had been smuggled out of the
way, that it might not be seen by the defendant&rsquo;s
agents.&nbsp; The judge, animadverting on this, and on the
evident perjury of the witness, said it would be better <!-- page
249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>that the horse should be seen by him and other
parties.&nbsp; The Solicitor-General, who appeared for the
defendant, was anxious that the horse should be seen by
veterinary surgeons.&nbsp; To which the other side objected,
maintaining that the mark of mouth, by which, alone, those
surgeons could judge of the age of a horse, was a fallible
criterion.</p>
<p>On the conclusion of the evidence for the plaintiff, the
Solicitor-General, in addressing the jury for the defence,
denounced the case as a gross and scandalous fraud on the part of
the plaintiff.&nbsp; The case for the defendant was, that the
horse was not Running Rein at all, but a colt by Gladiator, out
of a dam belonging originally to Sir Charles Ibbotson; and that
it had the name, Running Rein, imposed upon it, being originally
called Maccabeus, and having been entered for certain stakes
under that designation.&nbsp; But his allegations were against
Goodman, not against Mr. Wood; the former had entered into a
conspiracy with other persons to run horses above the proper
age.&nbsp; The Gladiator colt had been entered for races, under
the name of Maccabeus, before Goodman purchased him; and to run
these races while the colt was in training for the Derby, for
which he was entered as Running Rein, Goodman hired an Irish
horse, which he disguised as Maccabeus, though a year older than
that horse.&nbsp; The Gladiator colt, the <i>soi-disant</i>
Running Rein, when he ran for the Derby, in 1844, was four years
old, the race being for three-year-old horses.&nbsp; After
hearing some evidence in support of these statements, the case
was adjourned till the following day.</p>
<p>The next day, when Mr. Baron Alderson took his seat upon the
Bench, a conversation ensued between Mr. Cockburn and the Judge,
respecting the production of the horse.&nbsp; Mr. Cockburn
asserted that it had been taken away without Mr. Wood&rsquo;s
knowledge, and thus it was out of his power to produce it; he
felt it would be vain to strive against the effect which must be
felt by the non-production of the horse, after the remarks of the
learned Judge on that point.&nbsp; After some conversation,
however, the case proceeded, and two witnesses for the defence
were examined, whose evidence <!-- page 250--><a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>went to
prove that Running Rein was, in fact, the Gladiator colt.&nbsp;
Mr. George Odell, a horse dealer at Northampton, said he could
swear to that fact; the colt had two marks on one leg.</p>
<p>Mr. Baron Alderson remarked: &ldquo;Now, if we could see the
horse, that would prove the case.&nbsp; Who keeps him away?&nbsp;
It is quite childish to act in this manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cockburn now stated that Mr. Wood was convinced that he
had been deceived, and gave up the case.</p>
<p>Mr. Baron Alderson then briefly addressed the jury with much
warmth, and in a most emphatic manner; directing them to find a
verdict for the defendant, observing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the opening of the case, a most atrocious fraud
has proved to have been practised; and I have seen, with great
regret, gentlemen associating themselves with persons much below
themselves in station.&nbsp; If gentlemen would associate with
gentlemen, and race with gentlemen, we should have no such
practices.&nbsp; But, if gentlemen will condescend to race with
blackguards, they must expect to be cheated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jury found for the defendant, and the effect of their
verdict was, that the Derby Stakes went to Orlando, and that
Crenoline should be considered the winner of the Two-Year-Old
Plate at Newmarket, run the previous year.</p>
<p><i>Punch</i>, in commenting upon Mr. Baron Alderson&rsquo;s
remarks, says: &ldquo;They&rdquo; (the gentlemen) &ldquo;go among
these knaves and swindlers, these low-bred ruffians, reeking of
gin and the stables, <i>to make money of them</i>.&nbsp; They
associate with boors and grooms, Jew gambling-house keepers,
boxers and bullies, for money&rsquo;s sake to be sure.&nbsp; What
other motive could bring such dandies into communication with
such scoundrels, any more than he would willingly incur an
infection, unless he had some end in view.&nbsp; And the noble
patrons of the Turf <i>have</i> a great end in view&mdash;that of
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This ought to have been sufficient roguery, one would think,
for one race, but it was not.&nbsp; A horse, named Rattan, was so
evidently &ldquo;nobbled,&rdquo; that two men connected with it,
Rogers and Braham, were warned off all the Jockey Club&rsquo;s
premises.</p>
<p><!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>And yet another case.&nbsp; A horse, named Leander, ran
in this race, and so injured its leg, that it was shot.&nbsp;
Shortly afterwards, it was suspected that it was four, instead of
three years old; and, on its being exhumed, <i>the lower jaw was
missing</i>.&nbsp; The resurrectionists, however, cut off the
head, and veterinary experts confirmed the previous
suspicions.&nbsp; For this, the owners, Messrs. Lichtwald, were,
for ever, disqualified from racing.&nbsp; This case occupied much
time before the Select Committee of the House of Lords.</p>
<p>The Select Committee on Gaming, in the Commons, in 1844,
report that: &ldquo;Your Committee have some evidence to show
that frauds are, occasionally, committed in Horse Racing, and in
betting on the Turf; but they feel difficulty in suggesting any
remedy for this evil, more stringent, or more likely to be
effectual, than those already in existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On June 1, two Royal visitors arrived here, the Emperor of
Russia and the King of Saxony.&nbsp; They had to pay the usual
penalty of hard labour for a week.</p>
<p>In the House of Commons, on 14 June, Mr. T. Duncombe presented
a petition from W. J. Linton, Joseph Mazzini, and two others,
complaining of their letters being opened before delivery, and
praying that &ldquo;The House would be pleased to grant, without
delay, a Committee to inquire and give immediate redress to the
petitioners, and prevent the recurrence of so unconstitutional
and infamous a practice.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir James Graham (Home
Secretary) replied that &ldquo;the House must be aware that from
as early a period as the reign of Queen Anne, power existed in
the hands of the Principal Secretary of State, to detain and open
letters passing through the Post Office; and the House would also
be aware that this power had come under the review of Parliament,
at so late a period as the year 1837, and by the Act of 1 Vic.,
this power of issuing warrants to open and detain letters,
continued still vested in the Secretaries of State.&nbsp; He
must, for fear of creating misapprehension by his answer, state
that the circumstances mentioned in the petition were, to a great
extent, untrue.&nbsp; As to three of the petitioners, he doubted
if their letters had ever been detained, and no warrant as to
them <!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>had been issued; but, as to one of
the petitioners, he had to state, that, on his responsibility, a
warrant had been issued as to the correspondence of that person,
which warrant was no longer in force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 2 July, a Committee of Secrecy was appointed &ldquo;to
inquire into the state of the Law in respect to the detaining and
opening of Letters at the General Post Office, and into the mode
under which the authority given for such detaining and opening
has been exercised, and to report their opinion and observations
thereupon to the House.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Committee met, took
evidence, and duly reported, when it being shewn that the
privilege was not often exercised (the total number of warrants
issued between 1799 and 1844 being only 372), and that, of late
years, the average of warrants had decreased, the public were
satisfied, and the subject dropped.</p>
<p>Chantrey&rsquo;s equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington,
which stands in front of the Royal Exchange, was uncovered,
amidst much cheering.&nbsp; It cost &pound;9,000 besides the
metal.</p>

</a></p>
<p>On 23 Sept. Barry, a clown at Astley&rsquo;s, fulfilled his
promise of sailing in a washing-tub drawn by geese, from Vauxhall
to Westminster.&nbsp; He successfully accomplished his voyage,
and repeated it on Oct. 11, from the Red House, Battersea (where
now is Battersea Park), to Vauxhall.</p>
<p>On 8 Oct. Louis Philippe, the King of the French, landed at
Portsmouth on a visit to the Queen.&nbsp; He was made a Knight of
the Garter, and generally f&ecirc;ted, and should have returned
to France, from Portsmouth on the 12th, but the <!-- page
253--><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>sea was too rough, and he had to cross from Dover,
instead; but even this trip was delayed by a great conflagration
at New Cross Station, so that he really did not depart until the
13th.</p>
<p>I meet with the first mention of that eminent fertiliser,
Guano, in a commercial point of view, in the <i>Times</i> of the
18 Oct., where it says that on 16th were put up for sale, at
Liverpool, in lots of 10 tons each, 180 tons of the best African
guano.&nbsp; But one lot of five tons was sold, and that fetched
&pound;5 12s. 6d.&nbsp; The next lot was not sold, in consequence
of the price offered being under that, and the whole of the
remaining lots were withdrawn, there being no probability of the
reserved price being realised.&nbsp; It was then being fetched
from Ichaboe, an island off the south-west coast of
Africa&mdash;but it was afterwards procured in large quantities
from the Chincha Islands, off the coast of Peru.</p>
<p>On 28 Oct. the Queen opened the New Royal Exchange, with great
State, and the Lord Mayor (W. Magnay, Esq.) was made a baronet;
the reading-room at Lloyd&rsquo;s was made into a Throne room for
the occasion, and a sumptuous <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> was served
in the Underwriters&rsquo; room.&nbsp; It was a very imposing
pageant and pretty sight; but, although the Exchange was formally
opened, no merchants assembled within its quadrangle until the
first of the following January.</p>
<p>Whilst on matters civic I must mention the very rare fact of
Sir William Magnay&rsquo;s successor in the office of Lord Mayor
(Mr. Alderman Gibbs), being hooted and yelled at, on 9 Nov.,
whilst going to Westminster, and returning thence.&nbsp; He had
been churchwarden of St. Stephen&rsquo;s, Walbrook, and the
popular mind was imbued with the idea that something was wrong
with his accounts, so they virtuously insulted him.&nbsp; He had
a hard enough time of it both by land and water, when going, what
his returning was, is best told by a contemporary:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ceremony within the Court of Exchequer having
terminated, similar uproarious shouts to those which had hailed
the arrival of the new Lord Mayor, now marked his embarcation for
the city; and, in his passage down the Thames, with but here and
there a solitary exception, the civic barge was <!-- page
254--><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>the target of repeated vollies of yells and groans,
levelled by no unskilful, or ineffective voices at it, from the
banks and bridges of the river.&nbsp; The landing at Blackfriars
was attended with a more concentrated attack of &lsquo;public
execration,&rsquo; for, there, an immense multitude was wedged
together, anxious to be spectators of the scene, though not
inactive ones.&nbsp; On the procession passed amid the continued
manifestations of public disapprobation of the present, and
respect for the retiring Lord Mayor.&nbsp; Many interrogations of
a searching nature were repeatedly bawled forth, not that they
could reach the right honourable ear, but they were exercises in
that peculiar art, styled &lsquo;talking at folks.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The same description must apply to Ludgate Hill, St. Paul&rsquo;s
Churchyard, and Cheapside, in which place some merriment was
created by a party chanting in appropriate style:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Oh, Alderman Gibbs,<br />
Pray dub up the dibbs!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It was somewhat after 4 o&rsquo;clock, when the
cort&egrave;ge arrived at the bottom of King Street, where,
immediately before Guildhall Yard, about 2,000 persons had
collected, and others pressing out of the several streets, caused
a dense mass to be formed.&nbsp; This was the place where a
parting salutation was to be presented to the new Lord Mayor, by
his pitiless persecutors, and a very good view of the scene was
attainable from an upper window at the western angle of Gresham
Street.&nbsp; Hearty and continued cheering announced the
progress of Sir William Magnay; but, as soon as the State coach
with the new Lord Mayor arrived, the yells and groans which broke
forth, were perfectly stunning.&nbsp; Never was the manner in
which the two Lord Mayors had been received throughout the day,
marked with stronger contrast.&nbsp; The accumulation of
carriages in Guildhall Yard, caused the detention of the State
coach for some minutes, during which a real tempest of execration
was poured forth upon the unfortunate gentleman; and many persons
did not hesitate to testify their dislike to him in a manner to
be condemned, by spitting at the carriage, their distance from
which, however, defeated their <!-- page 255--><a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>intention.&nbsp; In truth, Mr. Gibbs had to endure a
perpetual and pitiless storm of hisses, yells, groans, gibes,
sneers and jeers; and at every stoppage where the crowd was in
close proximity to his carriage, unusually furious bursts of
indignation broke forth; yet no missile was thrown during any
portion of the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This year begins badly&mdash;with a murder&mdash;which I

which the electric telegraph lent its services for the detection
of a crime.&nbsp; A man named John Tawell, a member of the
Society of Friends, and who occupied a decent position in life,
poisoned a poor woman at Salt Hill.&nbsp; A Quaker who seemed
much confused had been met close by her house, and he went by
train from Slough to Paddington.&nbsp; Suspicion being aroused, a
message was sent from Slough, giving a description of him, and
asking that he should be shadowed on his arrival.&nbsp; This was
done, and, next day, he was arrested.&nbsp; He was tried, found
guilty, and duly executed.&nbsp; The case, at the time, created
an immense sensation, mainly because the villain was a member of
the Society of Friends.&nbsp; <i>Apropos</i> of this, the
<i>Observer</i> of 23 March is responsible for the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Murderer

made by a person, who is a Quaker, living near Berkhampstead, and
who is acquainted with Tawell: About a year ago, the stillness

which Tawell attended, was disturbed by one of the male members,
who suddenly rose from his seat and exclaimed, with frantic
earnestness, that there was then present, a person who was, at
that very moment, <!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>meditating a most fearful
crime.&nbsp; His conviction was so strong, that he passionately
besought this individual, whoever, he might be, to reflect upon
the wickedness of his intention, and to implore his Maker&rsquo;s
pardon for his murderous thoughts.&nbsp; As may be imagined, the
Friends were thrown into great consternation by this strange and
impetuous appeal, and the meeting broke up in alarm and
confusion.&nbsp; Tawell was present at the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early in January the statue of King William IV., by Samuel
Nixon, was placed on its pedestal, fronting London Bridge; but,
as far as I know, there was no public ceremony at its
inauguration, for the <i>Times</i> of 1 Feb. says: &ldquo;That
workmen are now actively employed in cleansing down the colossal
figure of King William IV., preparatory to the hoarding being
removed, and the statue thrown open to the view of the
public.&nbsp; The base will present a very novel and pleasing
appearance, it being ornamented with numerous naval
trophies.&nbsp; The four cross footpaths leading to the figure
will be lighted by four gas lamps, on massive granite
pillars.&nbsp; In a few days the whole work will be completed,
when it will be inspected by Her Majesty, the Queen Dowager, and
His Royal Highness Prince Albert, those illustrious personages
having intimated their desire to view it when
finished.&rdquo;@</p>
<p>On 15 January the Queen paid a visit to the Duke of
Buckingham, at Stowe, and the magnificence of her reception had
much to do with the financial collapse of the too generous
Duke.&nbsp; On leaving Stowe she went to Strathfieldsaye to stay
with the Duke of Wellington.&nbsp; It was on this occasion that
the old Duke gave a lesson to the gentlemen of the Press, which
the interviewers of our times might well take to heart:
&ldquo;Field-Marshal the Duke of Wellington presents his
compliments to Mr. ---, and begs to say he does not see what his
house at Strathfieldsaye has to do with the public
press.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 21 Jan. a National Testimonial was presented to Rowland
Hill for his labours in connection with the introduction of the
Penny Post, and Mr. Larpent, the Chairman of the City of London
Mercantile Committee on Postage, handed him <!-- page 258--><a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>a cheque
for &pound;10,000, which handsome sum had been raised by a public
subscription, which was not confined to the mercantile community
alone, persons of every rank, and of both sexes, contributing
amounts varying from large sums to a few pence.</p>
<p>Just before the closing of the British Museum at 4 p.m. on 7
Feb., a crash was heard, and the famous Barberini, or Portland
Vase, was found in pieces on the floor.&nbsp; A man, named Lloyd,
in a fit of delirium produced by drink, had smashed it out of
pure wantonness.&nbsp; The vase was valued at &pound;1,000 by the
Museum authorities, but, of course, that sum was purely nominal,
as the vase was unique.&nbsp; It was deposited in the British
Museum in the year 1810 by the Duke of Portland, and was
considered as his property; hence the name of the &ldquo;Portland
Vase.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was found about the middle of the 16th
century, about two and a half miles from Rome, on the road
leading from Frascati.&nbsp; At the time of its discovery it was
enclosed in a marble sarcophagus, within a sepulchral chamber,
under the mount called Monte di Grano.&nbsp; The material of
which it is made is glass, the body being of a beautiful
transparent dark blue, enriched with figures in relief, of opaque
white glass.&nbsp; For more than two centuries it was the
principal object of admiration in the Barberini Palace.&nbsp; It
came into the possession of Sir William Hamilton, from whom it
was purchased by the Duchess of Portland.</p>
<p>On 11 Feb. the delinquent was brought before Mr. Jardine, at
Bow Street, and the Museum authorities electing to prosecute him
for the minor offence of breaking the glass case which held the
vase, and which was under the value of &pound;5, he was convicted
of that offence, and sentenced to pay &pound;3, or two
months&rsquo; hard labour in the House of Correction.&nbsp; He
could not pay, and was committed to prison, in default, but on 13
Feb., someone paid the money, and the man was released.</p>
<p>An employ&eacute; of the British Museum, named Doubleday,
undertook, and effected, the restoration of the Vase, and it may
now be seen in the Gold Room of the British Museum, but, alas!
&ldquo;all the King&rsquo;s horses, and all the King&rsquo;s
men,&rdquo; <!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>can never make it as it was.&nbsp;
Wedgwood feebly reproduced it in ceramic ware, copies of which
are now worth &pound;200 each, and one copy, if not more, was
made in silver.</p>
<p>I come across a curious paragraph in the <i>Morning Post</i>
of March 13: &ldquo;<span class="smcap">William
Austin</span>.&mdash;This person, whose name must be familiar to
all who have had any acquaintance with the history of the
Parliamentary proceedings in the case of the late Queen Caroline,
or the eventful life of that unhappy Princess, arrived in London,
last week, from Milan, where he has been residing for several
years, for the most part, in a state of fatuity, the inmate of a
lunatic asylum.&nbsp; We understand that he has been removed to
this country through the intervention of the British Government,
under an authority from the Lord Chancellor, in whose care, his
person, and some considerable property, left to him by the late
Queen, have been placed by certain proceedings on the part of his
relations.&nbsp; He was conveyed hither from Milan under the
charge of a medical and two other attendants; and immediately on
his arrival, was visited by two London physicians, who, after an
interview with him of some duration, at the hotel where he
stopped, signed the necessary certificate for his detention in a
private asylum, where he now remains.&nbsp; Austin is a very
good-looking man, apparently about 40 years of age; and though,
beyond doubt, mentally enfeebled, has no betrayal of such
imbecility in the expression of his face.&nbsp; He has been in
his present unfortunate condition since the year 1830; and, for a
great part of that time, he has maintained an immovable
taciturnity.&nbsp; No ingenuity has been able to extract a
syllable from him.&nbsp; He answers no questions, nor asks
any&mdash;enters into no conversation&mdash;and, even during the
whole journey from Milan to London, he never spoke a word to his
attendants, or any one else.&nbsp; Neither could the medical
gentlemen who waited upon him here induce him to reply to any of
their inquiries; and no doubt, this fact, of itself, formed no
inconsiderable ingredient in the judgment at which they
arrived.&nbsp; The unhappy man is extremely docile, has no
disposition to violence, and readily understands and obeys any
signs made to him.&rdquo;</p>

Manchester on 17 March, and fetched high prices; a fine black
maned lion, &pound;350; another, 6 years old, &pound;310; two
lion cubs, eight months old, male and female, sold, the one for
&pound;12 10/-, the other for &pound;35.&nbsp; An elephant
realised &pound;750, and a giraffe &pound;400.</p>
<p>Hungerford Suspension Bridge, the first of its kind over the
Thames, was opened on 1 May, and, although a toll was demanded,
it was calculated that, before dusk, some 25,000 persons had
crossed from one side of the Thames to the other.&nbsp; It was
taken down in July, 1862, to make room for the Charing Cross
Railway Bridge.&nbsp; It was transferred to Clifton, and there
opened, on 8 Dec., 1864, and it now spans the Avon.</p>
<p>On the next day (2 May) a terrible accident occurred at the
Suspension bridge at Great Yarmouth.&nbsp; A clown was to emulate
Barry&rsquo;s folly, and cross the river in a washing-tub drawn
by geese; and thousands of people assembled to see him, of whom a
great number (accounts vary from 300 to 600), containing very
many children, were on the bridge.&nbsp; Some of the suspension
rods snapped, and the crowd fell into the water.&nbsp; Every
assistance was rendered, but the number of recovered dead bodies,
nearly all children, or young persons, was 77, and many are
supposed to have been swept away by the current.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of May, the famous Excise trial at Bar,
<i>i.e.</i>, before twelve judges, the Attorney General <i>v.</i>
Smith, came to an end, after lasting eight days.&nbsp; Mr. George
Smith was a distiller, in a large way of business, at
Whitechapel, and the premises of his brother James, who was a
rectifier, adjoined his.&nbsp; The law forbids the junction of
the businesses of distilling and rectifying, or any communication
between premises carrying on such businesses; and, in this case,
it was presumed that all spirit would be conveyed from one to the
other by means of the highway.&nbsp; But the contention of the
prosecution was, that the Excise officers, finding a great
deficiency in the spirits ostensibly produced, as compared with
the &ldquo;wash,&rdquo; had detected holes in a large receiver,
and found, moreover, that they could themselves convey spirits
from the distillery <!-- page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>to the rectifying house, through
pipes under ground, which were mixed up with those which supplied
water, and so escaped detection.&nbsp; This the defendants
denied, and brought forward evidence that the pipes were obsolete
and disused.&nbsp; In the end, the verdict of the jury was,
&ldquo;We find for the Crown; but we are anxious to express our
opinion that there has not been any evidence adduced before us
which shows that the pipe has been fraudently used by the
defendant.&rdquo;&nbsp; The amount of damages claimed by the
Crown was &pound;150,000; but, by agreement, this was reduced to
&pound;76,000; and, finally, after an appeal from Mr. Smith, the
Government were content with a cheque for &pound;10,000.</p>
<p>About this time commenced what is well termed &ldquo;The
Railway Mania,&rdquo; or, rather, public attention was
particularly called to it, as it was becoming a crying
scandal.&nbsp; So much so, that it attracted the notice of the
legislature; and, if we look at a &ldquo;Return to the Order of
the Honourable the House of Commons, dated 8th April, 1845, for
an alphabetical list of the Names, Description, and Places of
Abode, of all Persons subscribing to the Amount of &pound;2,000
and upwards to any Railway Subscription Contract deposited in the
Private Bill Office during the present Session of
Parliament,&rdquo; we shall see that amongst the names will be
found many of the leading nobility, large manufacturing firms,
names well known in commerce and literature, mingled together in
a most heterogeneous manner.&nbsp; The same column shows a
combination of peers and printers, vicars and vice-admirals,
spinsters and half-pay officers, Members of Parliament and
special pleaders, professors and cotton spinners,
gentlemen&rsquo;s cooks and KC.&rsquo;s, attorneys&rsquo; clerks
and college scouts, waiters at Lloyd&rsquo;s, relieving officers
and excisemen, editors and engineers, barristers and butchers,
Catholic priests and coachmen, dairymen and dyers, braziers,
bankers, beer sellers and butlers, domestic servants, footmen and
mail guards, and almost every calling under the sun.</p>
<p>And these, it must be remembered, were subscribers for
&pound;2,000 and upwards; those who put down their names for less
were supposed to be holders of &pound;21,386 6s. 4d. in
Stock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pass&rsquo;d through the lonely street,&nbsp; The

feet&nbsp; Clapping to and fro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There stood a potato-man&nbsp; In the midst of all the

<p>&ldquo;Two gents of dismal mien, And dank and greasy

railroad shares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wondered more and more; Says one, &lsquo;Good friend

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wrote for twenty,&rsquo; says Jim,&nbsp;
&lsquo;But they wouldn&rsquo;t give me one&rsquo;;&nbsp; His

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I lost, for I couldn&rsquo;t pay&nbsp; That

I say&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s stop, my boy, and sup.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at this simple feast,&nbsp; The while they did

</blockquote>
<p>And yet another extract.&nbsp; Who does not remember
Thackeray&rsquo;s <i>Diary of C. Jeames de la Pluche</i>,
<i>Esqre.</i>? but few know how the idea was started.&nbsp; It
was by W. M. T. himself in <i>Punch</i> of Aug. 2:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">A LUCKY SPECULATOR.</p>
<p>Considerable sensation has been excited in the upper and lower
circles in the West End, by a startling piece of good fortune
which has befallen <span class="smcap">James Plush Esq.</span>,
lately footman in a respected family in Berkeley Square.</p>
<p>One day, last week, <span class="smcap">Mr. James</span>
waited upon his master, who is a banker in the City; and, after a
little blushing and <!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>hesitation, said he had saved a
little money in service, and was anxious to retire, and invest
his savings to advantage.</p>
<p>His master (we believe we may mention, without offending
delicacy, the well-known name of <span class="smcap">Sir George
Flimsy</span>, of the firm of <span class="smcap">Flimsy</span>,
<span class="smcap">Diddler and Flash</span>) smilingly asked
<span class="smcap">Mr. James</span> what was the amount of his
savings, wondering considerably how&mdash;out of an income of
thirty guineas, the main part of which he spent in bouquets, silk
stockings and perfumery&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mr.
Plush</span> could have managed to lay by anything.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Plush</span>, with some hesitation,
said he had been <i>speculating in railroads</i>, and stated his
winnings to have been thirty thousand pounds.&nbsp; He had
commenced his speculations with twenty, borrowed from a
fellow-servant.&nbsp; He had dated his letters from the house in
Berkeley Square, and humbly begged pardon of his master, for not
having instructed the railway secretaries, who answered the
applications, to apply at the area bell.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir George</span>, who was at breakfast,
instantly arose, and shook Mr. P. by the hand; <span
class="smcap">Lady Flimsy</span> begged him to be seated, and
partake of the breakfast which he had laid on the table; and has,
subsequently, invited him to her grand <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> at
Richmond, where it was observed that <span class="smcap">Miss
Emily Flimsy</span>, her beautiful and accomplished seventh
daughter, paid the lucky gentleman <i>marked</i> attention.</p>
<p>We hear it stated that Mr. P. is of very ancient family (<span
class="smcap">Hugo de la Pluche</span> came over with the
Conqueror); and the new Brougham which he has started, bears the
ancient coat of his race.</p>
<p>He has taken apartments at the Albany, and is a director of
thirty-three railroads.&nbsp; He purposes to stand for Parliament
at the next general election, on decidedly conservative
principles, which have always been the politics of his
family.</p>
<p>Report says that, even in his humble capacity, <span
class="smcap">Miss Emily Flimsy</span> had remarked his high
demeanour.&nbsp; Well, &ldquo;none but the brave,&rdquo; say we,
&ldquo;deserve the fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This we may call the commencement of the mania; in their
proper places will be noticed its culmination and collapse.</p>
<p><!-- page 265--><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>On 18 May sailed from Greenhithe the two Arctic
discovery ships, the <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i>, under the
command of Sir John Franklin, whose instructions were &ldquo;to
push to the westward, without loss of time, in the latitude of
about 74&frac14; degrees, till you have reached the longitude of
that portion of land on which Cape Walker is situated, or about
98 degrees west.&nbsp; From that point we desire that every
effort be used to endeavour to penetrate to the southward and
westward, in a course as direct towards Behring&rsquo;s Straits
as the position and strength of the ice, or the existence of
land, at present unknown, may admit.&nbsp; We direct you to this
particular part of the Polar Sea, as affording the best prospect
of accomplishing the passage to the Pacific.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were provisioned for three years, but when, in 1850,
Captain Ommanney discovered, on Beechey Island, traces of the
expedition having spent their first winter there, he found large
stacks of preserved meat canisters, which, there is little doubt,
contained putrid filth, and had been condemned by survey.</p>
<p>As nothing was heard of the expedition, another was organised,
in 1847, to start, for search and relief, from Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay; and, indeed, no one can say that the two exploring vessels
were forgotten; for, from that date, till 1857, <i>thirty-nine
different expeditions were sent to look after them</i>.&nbsp; The
first to find traces of them was that of Capt. Ommanney, in 1850;
then, in April, 1854, Dr. Rae heard, from the natives, of a party
of white men having been seen, four winters previously, and that
their bodies had afterwards been seen.&nbsp; From these Eskimo,
Rae obtained some silver spoons and other small articles which
left no doubt but that they had belonged to the ill-fated
expedition.&nbsp; But it was the <i>Fox</i> yacht, which was
fitted out by Lady Franklin, and commanded by Capt. McClintock,
which settled the question of their fate.&nbsp; Early in 1859, a
boat, a few skeletons, chronometers, clothing, instruments,
watches, plate, books, etc., were discovered; and, towards the
end of May, a written paper was found, which gave news of them up
to 25 Apl., 1848, and told that &ldquo;Sir John Franklin died on
11 June, 1847, and the total losses <!-- page 266--><a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>by deaths
in the expedition has been, to this date, nine officers and 15
men; we start on, to-morrow, 26th, for Back&rsquo;s Fish
River.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the Eskimo was learned how one of the
ships sunk in deep water, and the other was wrecked, after which
they all perished miserably, some &ldquo;falling down and dying
as they walked,&rdquo; as an old woman told Capt. McClintock.</p>

<p>The Queen gave a Costume Ball, at Buckingham Palace, on 6th
June, which was a magnificent affair, and gave plenty of food for
conversation.&nbsp; Every guest had to appear in a costume
appropriate to the period of English history between 1740 and
1750; but, with the exception of the minuet, the dances were
modern.</p>
<p>I have only space for the dresses of the Queen and Prince
Albert.&nbsp; Her Majesty&rsquo;s dress was composed of gold
tissue, brocaded in coloured flowers, green leaves and silver,
trimmed round the top, bottom and sides (the upper dress being
open in front) with point lace over red ribbon; the dress looped
up with red satin ribbons, and two large bows, in each of which
was a diamond bow and tassel.&nbsp; The stomacher was composed of
two large diamond bows, and a diamond point; the sleeves, which
were tight, finished with point lace ruffles, and trimmed with
red ribbon; on the left arm, the Garter in diamonds, and, on the
right, a diamond rosette.&nbsp; She wore the blue ribbon and
diamond George as usual.&nbsp; The under petticoat was of white
and silver tissue, trimmed with a deep flounce of rich point lace
(which had belonged to Queen Charlotte), headed by a quilling of
red satin ribbon and bows; above, a narrower flounce of point
lace, trimmed like the other; in each ribbon bow, a diamond
rosette.</p>
<p>Prince Albert wore a suit of the richest crimson velvet <!--
page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>(of Spitalfields manufacture); the coat lined with
white satin, edged throughout with gold; and the buttons were of
gold.&nbsp; On his left breast His Royal Highness wore a most
splendid star of the order of the Garter, composed of diamonds,
with the exception of the cross, which was formed of
rubies.&nbsp; The badge of the Order was confined at the shoulder
by an epaulette composed of large brilliants, and a most splendid
George was suspended from the ribbon, wholly formed of
brilliants.&nbsp; The Prince also wore the insignia of the Golden
Fleece, formed of opals and diamonds.&nbsp; The Garter was set in
brilliants, and the hilt of His Royal Highness&rsquo;s sword was
covered with diamonds.&nbsp; The waistcoat was of white satin,
richly and elegantly embroidered with gold, the buttons being of
gold.&nbsp; Shoe buckles of diamonds.&nbsp; Hat, three cornered,
edged with gold lace, with handsome diamond ornament in the
cockade in front.</p>
<p>The Earl of Cardigan could not masquerade as Bayard, but
&ldquo;he excited no little attention.&nbsp; He wore the uniform
of the 11th Dragoons at Culloden; and, with the costume, which
became him extremely, he contrived to assume the portentous
bearing, and the true jack-boot stride and swagger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Morning Chronicle</i> is answerable for the following:
&ldquo;For some time past the copper coinage of William IV. has
been eagerly purchased by persons who are stated to be Jews, and
a report has, in consequence, gained ground that gold is
contained in it.&nbsp; What reason there may be for this it is
impossible to say; but it is a well-known fact, that agents have
been at work for the last two months buying up those particular
coins in Westminster, and they now fetch double the price of
their legal issue.&nbsp; The mania has extended eastward, and
twopence for a penny piece, and a penny for a halfpenny, etc.,
are now asked for the &lsquo;precious issue.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 9 June, the new street connecting Holborn with Oxford
Street, and now called New Oxford Street, was thrown open for
carriages.</p>
<p>Messrs. Christie and Manson sold, at the Egyptian Hall,
Piccadilly, on 23 June, the first portion of the &ldquo;Napoleon
Museum,&rdquo; collected by Mrs. Sainsbury, and which had long
<!-- page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>been on exhibition.&nbsp; The prices fetched were
ridiculously low, as the following examples will show.&nbsp;
Among the bronzes, an infantine bust of the King of Rome,
formerly in the possession of Josephine, at Malmaison, cost 20
guineas, sold for &pound;1 10s.&nbsp; A drawing in sepia, by
Debret, of Napoleon visiting the wounded on the field, after the
battle of Eylau, &pound;5 5s.&nbsp; The pictures illustrative of
the principal events in the life of Napoleon, were almost given
away; the highest price obtained, being &pound;12 for one by the
great French painter David, of Napoleon, with the crown raised in
both his hands, to place on the head of Josephine, at the
Coronation in Notre Dame.&nbsp; Twenty beautiful enamels by
Lienard, of Napoleon, Ney, Berthier, Junot, Joseph, Lucien, Louis
and Jerome Bonaparte, Murat, Caroline, the youngest sister of
Napoleon, Cardinal Fesch, Marie Louise, etc., fetched but
&pound;76, and, on the other days&rsquo; sales, the lots went for
far under their value.</p>
<p>My readers may possibly remember how, on 8 Dec., 1900, a
number of Nelson relics in the Painted Hall, at Greenwich
Hospital, were stolen, during the night, by a burglar, who
escaped; and may like to know the story of Nelson&rsquo;s
coat.&nbsp; The <i>Times</i> of 9 July, copies the following from
the <i>Spectator</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An interesting relic of Nelson has been
discovered; and some interest also attaches to the manner in
which it has been secured to the nation.&nbsp; Sir Harris
Nicolas, in his laborious researches for editing the hero&rsquo;s
Despatches, had satisfied himself that the coat and waistcoat
which Nelson wore when he fell at Trafalgar, were carefully
preserved.&nbsp; In pursuance of the Admiral&rsquo;s directions,
they were given, with several other things, by Sir Thomas Hardy,
his captain, to Lady Hamilton; by her, they were transferred,
under peculiar circumstances, to a late alderman of London, and
they remained in the possession of the alderman&rsquo;s
widow.&nbsp; The lady is not rich, and she asked &pound;150 for
the relic.&nbsp; This sum being beyond his own means, Sir Harris
determined to raise it by subscription, in order that the coat
and waistcoat might be deposited, like the coat which Nelson wore
at the battle of the Nile, in Greenwich Hospital.&nbsp; With that
view, he put <!-- page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>the proposition in writing, and had
it printed as a circular.&nbsp; Before issuing this circular,
however, he sent a copy to Prince Albert, who immediately desired
that the purchase might be made for himself, as he should feel
&lsquo;pride and pleasure&rsquo; in presenting the precious
memorials to Greenwich Hospital.&nbsp; Sir Harris Nicolas took
them to the Royal purchaser on Wednesday; and we understand that
the Prince manifested a very fine feeling on the occasion.&nbsp;
There is kind and generous wisdom in this act; for nothing could
so help to identify the Queen&rsquo;s husband with the British
people, as such little tributes to their maritime pride.&nbsp;
The coat is thus described in Sir Harris Nicolas&rsquo;s
circular, and it will be seen that it has an historic value:
&lsquo;The coat is the undress uniform of a vice-admiral, lined
with white silk, with lace on the cuffs, and epaulettes.&nbsp;
Four stars&mdash;of the Order of the Bath, St. Ferdinand and
Merit, the Crescent, and St. Joachin&mdash;are sewn on the left
breast, as Nelson habitually wore them; which disproves the story
that he purposely adorned himself with his decorations on going
into battle!&nbsp; The course of the fatal ball is shewn by a
hole over the left shoulder, and part of the epaulette is torn
away; which agrees with Dr. Sir William Beattie&rsquo;s account
of Lord Nelson&rsquo;s death, and with the fact, that pieces of
the bullion and pad of the epaulette adhered to the ball, which
is now in Her Majesty&rsquo;s possession.&nbsp; The coat and
waistcoat are stained in several places with the hero&rsquo;s
blood.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further confirmatory evidence is given in the <i>Globe</i>,
copied into the <i>Times</i> of 22 July.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will
scarcely be believed that the coat of the great naval hero,
together with his cocked hat, and an immense quantity of his
property, was, as it were, mortgaged for the sum of &pound;120,
yet such was the fact.&nbsp; The late Alderman Jonathan Joshua
Smith was executor of Lord Nelson with Lady Hamilton; and, prior
to his death, goods sufficient to fill six crates (amongst which
were the coat, hat, breeches, etc.), were placed in the Town
Hall, Southwark, under the care of Mr. Kinsey, the chief officer,
and who now attends the aldermen at the Central Criminal
Court.&nbsp; Kinsey was Alderman Smith&rsquo;s confidential
servant for a number of <!-- page 271--><a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>years, and
to whom &pound;120 was owing at his master&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;
Application was made to the Court of Aldermen, by some members of
the Nelson family, for the restitution of the property; and,
after a long discussion, Alderman Lucas consented to act as
arbitrator between the family and Kinsey, and &pound;30 was paid
to the latter, in satisfaction of his claim, upon which, the
things were repacked, and sent to Mrs. Smith, at Heron Court,
Richmond, in whose possession they remained, until the purchase
of the coat was made by Prince Albert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King of the Netherlands paid the Queen a visit on 24 July,
and the good man must have thought well of us, inasmuch as he was
very much let do as he liked.&nbsp; In London he stopped at
Mivart&rsquo;s Hotel, went to the Opera, paid a few visits, was a
guest of the Duke of Richmond for Goodwood Races, was made a
Field Marshal, held a review in Hyde Park, and went back again; a
far lighter sentence than is usually passed on Royalty when
visiting this country.</p>
<p>We now find the inflation of Railway speculation attracting
attention; and, in the <i>Times</i> of Aug. 1 is a letter, a
column in length, of which I give the following extract,
referring to the inquiry into the Dublin and Galway Railway:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The next case is that of letters addressed
to 1, Park Place, Devonshire Street, Mile End Road.&nbsp; So
great is the number of letters delivered here, that additional
assistance has been given in the duty.&nbsp; Upwards of 1,000
letters have been delivered here within nine months; only last
week 120 were taken in on one day, of which, at one time, no less
than 16, and, at another, 30, letters were delivered.&nbsp; This
No. 1, Park Place, is up an obscure court, consisting of three
small houses, of about 5/6 rent per week.&nbsp; No. 1 is occupied
by a man and woman, and the next door by their daughter.&nbsp;
The proceedings of these persons have been closely watched.&nbsp;
Directly a packet of letters has been received in the morning,
off starts the old man and woman, and, sometimes, the daughter,
to the places appointed to meet the receiver.&nbsp; On the first
occasion, the old woman, who had received 16 letters, evidently
wanted to deposit her treasure at Crosby Hall Chambers; for,
opposite to them, she halted, carefully looking <!-- page
272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>about her; but, unfortunately, she found she was
watched; and, escaping through the Excise Office, hid herself
somewhere, till her pursuer lost her.&nbsp; The next morning,
another packet was received, with which the old man was
intrusted; he started immediately, and, after a most circuitous
route, to avoid detection as to where he deposited his treasure,
he was seen to enter the King&rsquo;s Arms Tavern, Bishopsgate
Churchyard, where he was seen to deliver his despatches to a
smart, dapper Jew, well known, who, after a few moments&rsquo;
deliberation, left the house, and was speedily joined by several
confederates at the top of the churchyard, who, after dividing
the letters, dispersed as instantaneously as can be
imagined.&nbsp; The next day, it became necessary to augment the
detective force, for the old people became more wary; the old man
went out before post time, and the daughter was selected as the
messenger with despatches; she was fleet of foot, but she had
been carefully identified, therefore that did not avail her much,
as the detective force was divided, and stationed at such places
as were likely to succeed.&nbsp; She took a most circuitous
route, but, eventually, found herself opposite the Auction Mart,
evidently looking out anxiously for someone; she saw she was
watched, and away she started, and, after a long round, found
shelter in Maidenhead Court, Aldersgate Street, in a little
smith&rsquo;s shop&mdash;which turned out to belong to the
identical party who resides at No. 1, Park Place, where the
letters were first delivered.&nbsp; Here the pursuit was given
up.&nbsp; No further attempt to trace the receiver was made, the
inquiry before the select committee coming on; but sufficient is
shown to exhibit the system existing to this hour.&nbsp; How, it
may be asked, do they procure the signatures to the deed, one
party holding so many letters of allotment?&nbsp; The system is
this: one party signs the deed as often as disguise will shield
him from discovery; then the practice is resorted to of procuring
persons, from 15 years to 60, to accompany the holder of the
banker&rsquo;s receipt to the Railway Office, to sign the deed in
such name as he may direct; for which, when done, he receives
remuneration, varying from one shilling to ten, according to the
premium the scrip may bear in the market.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page
273--><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>There were several police cases as to writing and
forging these bogus names, and prudent people were beginning to
look shy at railway scrip.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a case which we can hardly understand nowadays.&nbsp;
As long as Newspapers were stamped, it was a misdemeanour to
allow anyone to read them, unless they purchased them, as it was
considered a fraud upon the Revenue.&nbsp; On 23 Aug., in the
Court of Requests, Kingsgate Street, a case came before the
Commissioners for adjudication, in which a newsvendor summoned a
person for a small sum, for &ldquo;reading&rdquo; the various
newspapers.&nbsp; The plaintiff, in stating the case, said the
defendant had been in the habit of seeing the papers daily, for
which a penny a day was charged, and the present proceedings were
taken to recover a balance due on that account.&nbsp; The
Commissioners said that he could not recover, as he had been
guilty of a gross fraud upon the Stamp Office in letting
newspapers out for hire.&nbsp; The plaintiff: But he was in the
habit of coming to my shop, and seeing them.&nbsp; The
Commissioner: That don&rsquo;t matter; it is a fraud upon the
Stamp Office, and you render yourself liable to an information
being laid against you for it.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Here is a little anecdote chronicled in the <i>Annual
Register</i> (6 Sep.): &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Reverse of
Fortune</span>.&mdash;Edward Riley, living with his family in
Hadley Street, Burton Crescent, having been proved next of kin to
Maj.-Gen. Riley, who recently died at Madras, leaving property to
the amount of &pound;50,000, to the whole of which he has become
entitled, has greatly amused the neighbourhood by his
conduct.&nbsp; From having been but a workman in the dust-yard in
Maiden Lane, he has, now, become a man of independence.&nbsp;
Some days after his sudden acquisition of wealth, he called, in
his cab, on a tailor in Seymour Street, and, taking him to the
dust yard, desired him to measure the whole of the men in the
yard for a suit of clothes, which being accomplished, he ordered
them to go to a bootmaker, where they were all served.&nbsp; On
the following Sunday, he ordered a butcher to supply each of them
with a joint of meat.&nbsp; Riley has taken a house in Argyle
<!-- page 274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>Square; and, upon entering it, purposes to give a
dinner to all the dustmen in London, and illuminate the front of
his house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have seen, in 1843, <i>Punch&rsquo;s</i> idea of Prince
Albert as a farmer, and we next hear of him, in connection with
this business, as refusing to pay parish rates for the Flemish
Farm; so at a vestry meeting held at Windsor, on 18 Sep., the
subject was brought forward.&nbsp; It appeared that the estimated
rental of the property was &pound;450, and that the last rate, at
8d. in the pound, amounting to &pound;15, had not been
paid.&nbsp; It was stated that the Prince had refused to pay the
rates on two grounds, first, that he had no &ldquo;beneficial
occupation,&rdquo; and, secondly, that &ldquo;the property
belonged to the Queen.&rdquo;&nbsp; The reply to this was, that
the Prince certainly had a beneficial occupation in the farm, for
the two prize oxen sold by him, last year, at &pound;70 and
&pound;80, were fatted on this farm, to say nothing of the crops
and agricultural produce, from which His Royal Highness received
great profits, and it was thought there was no reason why he
should be let off, and the poorer farmers made to pay the
rates.&nbsp; It was settled that the collector should make
application for the arrears, amounting to over &pound;200.</p>
<p><i>Punch</i> drew a harrowing picture, of the brokers being
put into Windsor Castle, and of a paragraph which might appear in
the <i>Court Circular</i>: &ldquo;Yesterday, Her Gracious Majesty
visited Prince Albert at her own Bench.&rdquo;&nbsp; But matters
did not go so far, for on 14 Jan. next following, the Prince
vouchsafed an answer to the Vestry, in which he denied his
liability <i>in toto</i>, acting on the advice of the Attorney
and Solicitor General, and Sir Thomas Wilde; and, after crushing
the poor vestry, the letter winds up thus: &ldquo;And His Royal
Highness feels himself at liberty to take the course which is
most satisfactory to his own feelings, and to pay, as a voluntary
contribution, a sum equal to the rate which would have been
annually due, had the legal liability of His Royal Highness been
established.&nbsp; It is also His Royal Highness&rsquo;s
intention that the payment of the sum referred to should commence
from the year 1841.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>And so it has continued to the present day, if we may
credit the authority quoted in the accompanying cutting from the
<i>Globe</i> of 8 June, 1901: &ldquo;<span class="smcap">How the
King Pays Taxes</span>.&mdash;It is not generally known (says the
<i>Free Lance</i>) that the King pays taxes under
protest&mdash;that is to say, His Majesty, like Queen Victoria,
claims to be exempt from impost, and yet is willing to
contribute, without prejudice, to the rates.&nbsp; For instance,
part of the Windsor farm land lies within the radius of the
borough.&nbsp; The municipal authority issues demand notes for
the rates.&nbsp; The Royal officials respond by paying a sum just
under the amount requested, and the collector is satisfied.&nbsp;
There is no question of going to law, for how can the King be
summoned in his own Courts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 31 Oct. Lieut. Waghorn practically demonstrated the
feasibility of his &ldquo;Overland Route&rdquo; to India.&nbsp;
The regular Mail and his Express arrived at Suez by the same
steamer on 19 Oct.&nbsp; The Express was given to a man on a
dromedary, who, stopping nowhere, entered Alexandria on the
20th.&nbsp; The Express was delivered to Mr. Waghorn, who started
at 11 o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; He had been waiting on board an
Austrian steamer, which had remained in quarantine, so that he
arrived at Trieste in free <i>pratique</i>.&nbsp; He landed,
however, at Divina, twelve miles nearer London than Trieste, and
hurried through Austria, Prussia, Baden, and Bavaria, with a
passport ready <i>vis&eacute;d</i> by the representatives of
those countries.&nbsp; He reached Mannheim in 84 hours, proceeded
by a steamer to Cologne, thence by special train to Ostend, by
boat to Dover, to London by railway, and arrived at 4.30 in the
morning of the 31st.&nbsp; The news from India thus brought, was
published in all the London papers, which were in Paris before
the Mail from Marseilles was on its way to London.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">The Railway Mania&mdash;Deposit of plans.</p>
<p>The accompanying illustration from <i>Punch</i> (18 Oct.)
justly holds up to ridicule the Railway Mania, which might then
be said to have been at its height.&nbsp; It is called
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The March of
Speculation</span>.&mdash;&lsquo;This is the young Gent, as takes
my Business, Mem.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m agoin&rsquo; into the
Railway&mdash;Director Line myself.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a proof of this Madness, see this paragraph: &ldquo;Oct.
25.&nbsp; During the past week there were announced, in three
newspapers, eighty-nine new schemes, with a capital of
&pound;84,055,000; during the month, there were 357 new schemes
announced, with an aggregate capital of
&pound;332,000,000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 17 Nov. the <i>Times</i> published a table of all the
railway companies registered up to the 31st October, numbering
1,428, and involving an outlay of &pound;701,243,208.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take away,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;&pound;140,000,000 for
railways completed, or in progress, exclude all the most
extravagant schemes, and divide the remainder by ten, can we add,
from our present resources, even a tenth of the vast
remainder?&nbsp; Can we add &pound;50,000,000 to the railway
speculations we are irretrievably embarked in?&nbsp; We cannot,
without the most ruinous, universal and desperate
confusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is a Parody on the situation, 1 Nov.:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was a sound, that ceased not day or
night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of speculation.&nbsp; London gathered then<br />
Unwonted crowds, and moved by promise bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Capel Court rushed women, boys and men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>All seeking railway shares and
scrip; and when<br />
The market rose, how many a lad could tell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With joyous glance, and eyes that spake again,<br />
&rsquo;Twas e&rsquo;en more lucrative than marrying
well;&mdash;<br />
When, hark, that warning voice strikes like a rising knell.</p>
<p>Nay, it is nothing, empty as the wind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But a &ldquo;bear&rdquo; whisper down Throgmorton
Street;<br />
Wild enterprise shall still be unconfined;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No rest for us, when rising premiums greet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The morn, to pour their treasures at our
feet;&mdash;<br />
When, hark! that solemn sound is heard once more,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gathering bears its echoes yet repeat&mdash;<br
/>
&rsquo;Tis but too true, is now the general roar,<br />
The Bank has raised her rate, as she has done before.</p>
<p>And then, and there were hurryings to and fro,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And anxious thoughts, and signs of sad distress,<br
/>
Faces all pale, that, but an hour ago<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Smiled at the thought of their own craftiness;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And there were sudden partings, such as press<br />
The coins from hungry pockets, mutual sighs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of brokers and their clients.&nbsp; Who can guess<br
/>
How many a &ldquo;stag&rdquo; already panting flies,<br />
When upon times so bright, such awful panics rise?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Francis, in his <i>History of the English Railway</i>,
says: &ldquo;The daily press was thoroughly deluged with
advertisements; double sheets did not supply space enough for
them; double doubles were resorted to, and, then, frequently,
insertions were delayed.&nbsp; It has been estimated that the
receipts of the leading journals averaged, at one period
&pound;12,000 and &pound;14,000 a week, from this source.&nbsp;
The railway papers, on some occasions, contained advertisements
that must have netted &pound;700 to &pound;800 on each
publication.&nbsp; The printer, the lithographer, and the
stationer, with the preparation of prospectuses, the execution of
maps, and the supply of other requisites, also made a
considerable harvest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The leading engineers were, necessarily, at a great
premium.&nbsp; Mr. Brunel was said to be connected with fourteen
lines, Mr. Robert Stephenson with thirty-four, Mr. Locke with
thirty-one, Mr. Rastrick with seventeen, and other engineers with
one hundred and thirteen.</p>
<p><!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>&ldquo;The novelist has appropriated this peculiar
portion of commercial history, and, describing it, says gravely
and graphically: &lsquo;A colony of solicitors, engineers and
seedy accountants, settled in the purlieus of Threadneedle
Street.&nbsp; Every town and parish in the Kingdom blazed out in
zinc plates over the doorways.&nbsp; From the cellar to the roof,
every fragment of a room held its committee.&nbsp; The darkest
cupboard on the stairs contained a secretary, or a clerk.&nbsp;
Men, who were never seen east of Temple Bar before, or since,
were, now, as familiar to the pavement of Moorgate Street, <a
name="citation279"></a><a href="#footnote279"
class="citation">[279]</a> as the stockbrokers; ladies of title,
lords, Members of Parliament, and fashionable loungers thronged
the noisy passages, and were jostled by adventurers, by gamblers,
rogues and imposters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The advantages of competition were pointed out, with
the choicest phraseology.&nbsp; Lines which passed by barren
districts, and by waste heaths, the termini of which were in
uninhabitable places, reached a high premium.&nbsp; The shares of
one company rose 2,400 per cent.&nbsp; Everything was to pay a
large dividend; everything was to yield a large profit.&nbsp; One
railway was to cross the entire Principality without a single
curve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shares of another were issued, the company formed,
and the directors appointed, with only the terminal points
surveyed.&nbsp; In the Ely railway, not one person connected with
the country through which it was to pass, subscribed the title
deed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The engineers who were examined in favour of particular
lines, promised all and everything in their evidence.&nbsp; It
was humourously said of them, &lsquo;they plunge through the
bowels of mountains; they undertake to drain lakes; they bridge
valleys with viaducts; their steepest gradients are gentle
undulations; their curves are lines of beauty; they interrupt no
traffic; they touch no prejudice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Labour of all kinds increased in demand.&nbsp; The
price of iron rose from sixty-eight shillings to
one-hundred-and-twenty <!-- page 280--><a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>per
ton.&nbsp; Money remained abundant.&nbsp; Promoters received
their tens and twenties of thousands.&nbsp; Rumours of sudden
fortunes were very plentiful.&nbsp; Estates were purchased by
those who were content with their gains; and, to crown the whole,
a grave report was circulated, that Northumberland House, with
its princely reminiscences, and palatial grandeur, was to be
bought by the South Western.&nbsp; Many of the railways attained
prices which staggered reasonable men.&nbsp; The more worthless
the article, the greater seemed the struggle to obtain it.&nbsp;
Premiums of &pound;5 and &pound;6 were matters of course, even
where there were four or five competitors for the road.&nbsp; One
company, which contained a clause to lease it at three-and-a-half
per Cent., for 999 years, rose to twenty premium, so mad were the
many to speculate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every branch of commerce participated in the advantages
of an increased circulation.&nbsp; The chief articles of trade
met with large returns; profits were regular; and all luxuries
which suited an affluent community, procured an augmented
sale.&nbsp; Banking credit remained facile; interest still kept
low; money, speaking as they of the City speak, could be had for
next to nothing.&nbsp; It was advanced on everything which bore a
value, whether readily convertible, or not.&nbsp; Bill brokers
would only allow one-and-a-half per cent. for cash; and what is
one-and-a-half to men who revelled in the thought of two
hundred?&nbsp; The exchanges remained remarkably steady.&nbsp;
The employment of the labourer on the new lines, of the operative
in the factory, of the skilled artisan in the workshop, of the
clerk at the desk, tended to add to the delusive feeling, and was
one of the forms in which, for a time, the population was
benefitted.&nbsp; But, when the strength of the Kingdom is wasted
in gambling, temporary, indeed, is the good, compared with the
cost.&nbsp; Many, whose money was safely invested, sold at any
price, to enter the share market.&nbsp; Servants withdrew their
hoards from the savings banks.&nbsp; The tradesman crippled his
business.&nbsp; The legitimate love of money became a fierce
lust.&nbsp; The peer came from his club to his brokers; the
clergyman came from his pulpit to the mart; the country gentleman
forsook the calmness of his rural domain for the feverish
excitement <!-- page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>of Threadneedle Street.&nbsp;
Voluptuous tastes were indulged in by those who were previously
starving.&nbsp; The new men vied with the old, in the luxurious
adornments of their houses.&nbsp; Everyone smiled with
contentment; every face wore a pleased expression.&nbsp; Some,
who, by virtue of their unabashed impudence, became provisional
committee-men, supported the dignity of their position in a style
which raised the mirth of many, and moved the envy of more.&nbsp;
Trustees, who had no money of their own, or who had lost it, used
that which was confided to them; brothers speculated with the
money of sisters; sons gambled with the money of their widowed
mothers; children risked their patrimony; and it is no
exaggeration to say, that the funds of hundreds were
surreptitiously endangered by those in whose control they were
placed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Railways had been projected, and, in order to carry them
through, the plans must, by law, be deposited with the Board of
Trade, before, or on 30 Nov.; and, on this occasion, there was a
scene, which is very well told in the <i>Annual Register</i>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;An extraordinary scene occurred at the office of the
Railway Department of the Board of Trade on this day (Sunday, 30
Nov.), being the last day on which the plans of the new projects
could be deposited with the Railway Board, in order to enable
Bills to authorise them to be brought before Parliament, in
compliance with the Standing Orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last year, the number of projects, in respect of which
plans were lodged with the Board of Trade, was 248; the number,
this year, is stated to be 815.&nbsp; The projectors of the
Scotch lines were mostly in advance, and had their plans duly
lodged on Saturday.&nbsp; The Irish projectors, too, and the
old-established companies, seeking powers to construct branches,
were among the more punctual.&nbsp; But upwards of 600 plans
remained to be deposited.&nbsp; Towards the last, the utmost
exertions were made to forward them.&nbsp; The efforts of the
lithographic draughtsmen and printers in London were excessive;
people remained at work, night after night, snatching a hasty
repose for a couple of hours, on lockers, benches, or the
floor.&nbsp; <!-- page 282--><a name="page282"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 282</span>Some found it impossible to execute
their contracts; others did their work imperfectly.&nbsp; One of
the most eminent was compelled to bring over four hundred
lithographers from Belgium, and failed, nevertheless, with this
reinforcement, in completing some of his plans.&nbsp; Post horses
and express trains, to bring to town plans prepared in the
country, were sought in all parts.&nbsp; Horses were engaged days
before, and kept, by persons specially appointed, under lock and
key.&nbsp; Some railway companies exercised their power of
refusing express trains for rival projects, and clerks were
obliged to make sudden and embarrassing changes of route, in
order to travel by less hostile ways.&nbsp; A large establishment
of clerks <!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>were in attendance to register the
deposits; and this arrangement went on very well, until eleven
o&rsquo;clock, when the delivery grew so rapid, that the clerks
were quite unable to keep pace with the arrivals.&nbsp; The
entrance hall soon became inconveniently crowded, considerable
anxiety being expressed lest twelve o&rsquo;clock should arrive
&rsquo;ere the requisite formalities should have been gone
through.&nbsp; This anxiety was allayed by the assurance that
admission into the hall before that hour, would be sufficient to
warrant the reception of the documents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the clock struck twelve, the doors of the office
were about to be closed, when a gentleman with the plans of one
of the Surrey railways arrived, and, with the greatest
difficulty, succeeded in obtaining admission.&nbsp; A lull of a
few minutes here occurred; but, just before the expiration of the
first quarter of an hour, a post chaise, with reeking horses,
drove up, in hot haste, to the entrance.&nbsp; In a moment, its
occupants (three gentlemen) alighted, and rushed down the
passage, towards the office door, each bearing a plan of
Brobdingnagian dimensions.&nbsp; On reaching the door, and
finding it closed, the countenances of all drooped; but one of
them, more valorous than the rest, and prompted by the
bystanders, gave a loud pull at the bell.&nbsp; It was answered
by Inspector Otway, who informed the ringer it was now too late,
and that his plans could not be received.&nbsp; The agents did
not wait for the conclusion of the unpleasant communication, but
took advantage of the door being opened, and threw in their
papers, which broke the passage lamp in their fall.&nbsp; They
were thrown back into the street.&nbsp; When the door was again
opened, again went in the plans, only to meet a similar fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the whole, upwards of 600 plans were duly
deposited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although the collapse of the Railway Mania really began in
1845, its effects were not fully felt until the commencement of
this year, when 10 per cent. on Railway Capital had to be lodged
with the Accountant General, within seven days from the
assembling of Parliament, which in this case meant the 29th
Jan.&nbsp; It really received its first serious wound when the
Bank of England rose its rate of discount on 16 Oct., but it was
only when the calls had to be paid, that it was found how rotten
the whole concern was, as the Marquis of Clanricarde, in a
speech, plainly exposed.&nbsp; Said he: &ldquo;One of the names
to the deed, to which he was anxious to direct their attention,
was that of a gentleman, said to reside in Finsbury Square, who
had subscribed to the amount of &pound;25,000; he was informed no
such person was known at that address.&nbsp; There was, also, in
the Contract deed, the name of an individual who had figured in
the Dublin and Galway Railway Case, who was down for
&pound;5,000, and who was understood to be a half-pay officer, in
the receipt of &pound;54 a year, but who appeared as a subscriber
in different railway schemes to the amount of
&pound;41,500.&nbsp; The address of another, whose name was down
for &pound;12,200, was stated to be in Watling Street, but it
appeared he did not reside there.&nbsp; In the case of another
individual down for &pound;12,500, a false address was found to
have been given.&nbsp; Another individual, whom he would not
name, was a curate in the parish in Kent; he might <!-- page
285--><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>be
worth all the money for which he appeared responsible in various
railway schemes, but his name appeared for &pound;25,000 in
different projects, and stood for &pound;10,000 in this
line.&nbsp; Another individual, who was down for &pound;25,000,
was represented to be in poor circumstances.&nbsp; A clerk in a
public company was down for upwards of &pound;50,000.&nbsp; There
were several more cases of the same kind, but he trusted he had
stated enough to establish the necessity of referring the matter
to a Committee.&nbsp; There were, also, two brothers, sons of a
charwoman, living in a garret, one of whom had signed for
&pound;12,500, and the other for &pound;25,000; these two
brothers, excellent persons, no doubt, but who were receiving
about a guinea and a half between them, were down for
&pound;37,000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story of the collapse is so admirably told by Mr. Francis,
that I prefer giving his version than writing of it myself:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Money was scarce, the price of stock and
scrip lowered; the confidence of the people was shaken, and a
vision of a dark future on every face.&nbsp; Advertisements were
suddenly withdrawn from the papers, men of note were seen no more
as provisional committeemen; distrust followed the merchant to
the mart and the jobber to the Exchange.&nbsp; The new schemes
ceased to be regarded; applications ceased to be forwarded;
premiums were either lowered, or ceased to exist.&nbsp; Bankers
looked anxiously to the accounts of their customers; bill brokers
scrutinised their securities; and every man was suspicious of his
neighbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the distrust was not confined to projected
lines.&nbsp; Established railways felt the shock, and were
reduced in value.&nbsp; Consols fell one and a half per cent.;
Exchequer bills declined in price, and other markets
sympathised.&nbsp; The people had awoke from their dream, and
trembled.&nbsp; It was a national alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Words are weak to express the fears and feelings which
prevailed.&nbsp; There was no village too remote to escape the
shock, and there was, probably, no house in town some occupant of
which did not shrink from the morrow.&nbsp; The Statesman started
to find his new Bank Charter so sadly and <!-- page 286--><a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>so suddenly
tried; the peer, who had so thoughtlessly invested, saw ruin
opening to his view.&nbsp; Men hurried with bated breath to their
brokers; the allottee was uneasy and suspicious, the provisional
committeeman grew pale at his fearful responsibility; directors
ceased to boast their blushing honours, and promoters saw their
expected profits evaporate.&nbsp; Shares which, the previous
week, were a fortune, were, the next, a fatality, to their
owners.&nbsp; The reputed shareholders were not found when they
were wanted; provisional committeemen were not more easy of
access.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One Railway advertised the names and addresses of
thirty&mdash;none of whom were to be heard of at the residences
ascribed to them.&nbsp; Letters were returned to the Post Office
day after day.&nbsp; Nor is this to be wondered at, when it is
said that, on one projected line, only &pound;60 was received for
deposits, which should have yielded &pound;700,000.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was proved in the Committee of the House of Commons,
that one subscription list was formed of &lsquo;lame ducks of the
Alley&rsquo;; and that, in another, several of the Directors,
including the Chairman, had, also, altered their several
subscriptions to the amount of &pound;100,000, the very evening
on which the list was deposited, and that five shillings a man
was given to anyone who would sign for a certain number of
shares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing more decidedly marked the crisis which had
arrived, than the fact that everyone hastened to disown
railways.&nbsp; Gentlemen who had been buried in prospectuses,
whose names and descriptions had been published under every
variation that could fascinate the public, who had figured as
Committeemen, and received the precious guineas for their
attendance, were eager to assure the world that they were
ignorant of this great transgression.&nbsp; Men who, a month
before, had boasted of the large sums they had made by scrip,
sent advertisements to papers denying their responsibility, or
appealed to the Lord Mayor to protect their characters.&nbsp;
Members of Parliament who had remained quiet under the
infliction, while it was somewhat respectable, fell back upon
their privileges, when they saw their purses in danger.&nbsp;
There is no doubt that an unauthorised use of names was one
feature <!-- page 287--><a name="page287"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 287</span>of fraudulent companies, and that,
amidst a list of common names, it was thought a distinguished one
might pass unnoticed.&nbsp; The complaints, therefore, of those
who were thus unceremoniously treated, were just; but the great
mass of denials emanated from persons who, knowingly, encountered
the risk, and, meanly, shrunk from the danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the conviction of those who were best informed,
that no other panic was ever so fatal to the middle class.&nbsp;
It reached every hearth, it saddened every heart in the
metropolis.&nbsp; Entire families were ruined.&nbsp; There was
scarcely an important town in England but what beheld some
wretched suicide.&nbsp; Daughters, delicately nurtured, went out
to seek their bread; sons were recalled from academies;
households were separated, homes were desecrated by the
emissaries of the law.&nbsp; There was a disruption of every
social tie.&nbsp; The debtors&rsquo; jails were peopled with
promoters; Whitecross Street was filled with speculators; and the
Queen&rsquo;s Bench was full to overflowing.&nbsp; Men, who had
lived comfortably and independently, found themselves suddenly
responsible for sums they had no means of paying.&nbsp; In some
cases, they yielded their all, and began the world anew; in
others, they left the country for the continent, laughed at their
creditors, and defied pursuit.&nbsp; One gentleman was served
with four hundred writs; a peer, when similarly pressed, when
offered to be relieved from all liabilities for &pound;15,000,
betook himself to his yacht, and forgot, in the beauties of the
Mediterranean, the difficulties which had surrounded him.&nbsp;
Another gentleman who, having nothing to lose, surrendered
himself to his creditors, was a director of more than twenty
lines.&nbsp; A third was Provisional Committeeman to
fifteen.&nbsp; A fourth, who commenced life as a printer, who
became insolvent in 1832 and a bankrupt in 1837, who had
negotiated partnerships, who had arranged embarrassed affairs,
who had collected debts, and turned his attention to anything,
did not disdain, also, to be a Railway promoter, a Railway
director, or to spell his name in a dozen different
ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But a notice of the Railway Mania would be very incomplete
without a mention of George Hudson, the Railway King.&nbsp; He
was born at Howsham, a village near York, in March, 1800; was
apprenticed to a draper in York; and, subsequently, became
principal in the business; thus, early in life, becoming well
off, besides having &pound;30,000 left him by a distant
relative.&nbsp; In 1837, he was Lord Mayor of York; and, the same
year, was made Chairman of the York and North Midland Railway,
which was opened in 1839.&nbsp; In 1841, he was elected Chairman
of the Great North of England Company; and, afterwards, held the
same position in the Midland Railway Company.&nbsp; He speculated
largely in railways, and, in the Parliamentary return, already
alluded to, his subscriptions appear as &pound;319,835.</p>
<p>He came to London, and inhabited the house at Albert Gate,
Knightsbridge (now the French Embassy), where he entertained the
Prince Consort, and the aristocracy generally.&nbsp; <!-- page
289--><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>He
was elected M.P. for Sunderland in Aug., 1845, and again served
as Lord Mayor of York in 1846.&nbsp; The Railway smash came; and,
year by year, things went worse with him, until, early in the
year 1849, he had to resign the Chairmanship of the Eastern
Central (now Great Eastern), Midland, York, Newcastle and
Berwick, and the York and North Midland Railway Companies.&nbsp;
He went abroad, where he lived for some time, and tried,
unavailingly, to retrieve his fortune.&nbsp; In July, 1865, he
was committed to York Castle for Contempt of the Court of
Exchequer, in not paying a large debt, and was there incarcerated
till the following October.</p>
<p>He fell so low, that, in 1868, some friends took pity on him,
and raised a subscription for him, thus obtaining &pound;4,800,
with which an annuity was purchased.&nbsp; He died in London, 14
Dec., 1871.</p>
<p>We have been so accustomed to have nigger minstrels with us
that I suppose very few of us know when they began.&nbsp; Of
course, I do not mean the solitary minstrel like Rice of
&ldquo;Jump Jim Crow&rdquo; fame, who was the first, coming over
here in 1836; but the first troupe.&nbsp; I find it in the
<i>Illustrated News</i> of 24 Jan., 1846, whence also comes this
illustration:</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;A party of American minstrels, under the above
designation, commenced on Wednesday night (21 Jan.), at the
Hanover Square Rooms, a series of concerts, for the avowed <!--
page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>purpose of affording an accurate notion of Negro
character and melody.&nbsp; These artists are remarkably clever,
and admirably &lsquo;made up.&rsquo;&nbsp; They are painted jet
black, with ruddy lips, and large mouths; and, being capital
actors, the deception created is so great, that wagers have been
offered that they are really &lsquo;darkies.&rsquo;&nbsp; They
dress in dandy costume, <i>&agrave; la Jullien</i>&mdash;that is,
white waistcoated and wristbanded, turned up in the most approved
D&rsquo;Orsay fashion.&nbsp; Of course, it is impossible to come
to any right conclusion as to the authenticity of the African
airs, especially as they have arranged the compositions of the
great European masters in such a grotesque manner.&nbsp; The
executants are five in number; one plays the tambourine, Mr.
Germon, who is the leader; another the bone castanet; the third,
the accordion; and the two others, the banjo, or African
guitar.&nbsp; The castanet player does not sing; but his four
colleagues have good voices, and, in glees, harmonize
charmingly.&nbsp; In a quartet, the parody on the Phantom Chorus,
from Bellini&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sonnambula&rsquo;; and in a glee,
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll See Them on the Ohio,&rsquo; nothing can be
more effective than the skilful blending of the parts.&nbsp; It
is, perhaps, the <i>buffo</i> exhibition which will create the
greatest sensation, and in this quality they are
inimitable.&nbsp; The tambourine performer affects a ludicrous
air of pompous sentiment, while the castanet sable hero indulges
in all kinds of buffoonery and antics.&nbsp; He is a wonderful
player&mdash;no Spaniard can rival him in rapidity, delicacy and
precision.&nbsp; A scene called a &lsquo;Railway Overture,&rsquo;
causes an explosion of laughter; they seem to be endowed with
perpetual motion; and the scream of the whistle, at the same time
as the noise of the engine, beggars all description.&nbsp; The
entertainment is quite a novelty, and will, no doubt, be
attractive.&nbsp; They have been provided with letters of
recommendation from President Polk, and some leading persons in
America, who must be better able to appreciate the accuracy of
their African delineations than Europeans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They <i>were</i> popular, with a vengeance&mdash;for every
little street arab had beef bones for castanets, and every new
song was roared out in the streets until it nauseated.&nbsp;
<i>Punch</i> drew <!-- page 291--><a name="page291"></a><span

Serenaders, and even suggested that Lablache, Mario and Tamburini
should adopt the style.</p>

<p>The Queen opened Parliament on 19 Jan., and in her speech,
whilst deprecating &ldquo;the very frequent instances in which
the crime of deliberate assassination has been, of late,
committed in Ireland,&rdquo; she went on: &ldquo;I have to lament
that, in consequence of a failure of the potato crop in several
parts of the United Kingdom, there will be a deficient supply of
an article of food which forms the chief subsistence of great
numbers of my people.&nbsp; The disease by which the plant has
been affected, has prevailed to the utmost extent in
Ireland.&nbsp; I have adopted all such precautions as it was in
my power to adopt, for the purpose of alleviating the sufferings
which may be caused by this calamity; and I shall confidently
rely on your co-operation in devising such other means for
effecting the same benevolent purpose, as may require the
sanction of the Legislature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 13 March, Parliament talked somewhat about the matter, and
Sir James Graham, the Home Secretary, confessed that distress
&ldquo;pervades the whole of Ireland.&nbsp; It is to be found in
every province, in every county, in every union; nay, almost in
every parish in Ireland.&nbsp; The course Her Majesty&rsquo;s
<!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>Government has taken, has been this.&nbsp; We have, in
particular parts of Ireland, established dep&ocirc;ts, where food
can be bought at an easy price, at the very lowest price, and,
thinking that eleemosynary relief ought to be avoided as much as
possible, we propose to afford, to the utmost possible extent,
either by means of public works to be undertaken, or by works
already established, the means by which the people may be enabled
to earn wages, and so to purchase food at the moderate cost at
which it will be supplied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, in spite of all the Government could do, with the very
best intentions, gaunt famine was stalking through the land, and
the hungry folk could not be quiet, with the sight of food before
them.&nbsp; They were not going to starve when they saw the
bakers&rsquo; shops full of bread, and the butchers&rsquo;, of
meat.&nbsp; Human nature and a hungry belly could not stand
it&mdash;so we can scarcely wonder at the famine riots which
ensued.&nbsp; The shops were wrecked, the food was taken; they
even laid their hands on a boat proceeding from Limerick to Clare
with relief, and plundered it of its cargo of corn and maize
flour.&nbsp; But, alas! this was only the commencement of the sad
story.</p>
<p>There was an alternative, open to those who had the
money&mdash;to emigrate&mdash;and this they did&mdash;see the
following, from the <i>Cork Reporter</i>, copied into the
<i>Times</i> of 18 April: &ldquo;For the last fortnight our quays
have been daily thronged with the fine and stalwart peasantry of
this and the adjoining counties, preparing to emigrate to various
parts of the trans-Atlantic world.&nbsp; Perhaps, upon no former
occasion, even before the hope of railway employment was held out
to the people, and when &ldquo;Government grants&rdquo; for their
relief were never heard of, did the number of emigrants from this
quarter exceed the proportion of this present year.&nbsp; Besides
the various large and full-freighted vessels, which have left the
quays of Cork, direct for America, several ships were despatched
to the west of the county, and had no difficulty in obtaining
their full complement of passengers.&nbsp; Two large ships went
round to Berehaven, a few days ago, and have, since, left the
shores of that bleak district, with over 200 passengers.&nbsp;
<!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>Several other vessels have proceeded, or are about to
proceed, for Baltimore and Berehaven, localities in which the
destitution of the present year has been severely felt.&nbsp;
Three hundred persons have been ready, for the last fortnight, to
embark from Dingle; but, not being able to get a ship to visit
them, sufficiently commodious for their accommodation, have been
obliged to make the best of their way to Cork.&nbsp; Several
vessels, now lying at Passage, will sail this day, these taking
five hundred and fifty passengers . . . At a moderate
computation, about 9,000 emigrants have, or, within the next
month, will have, left this port for America.&nbsp; It is to be
hoped their anticipations will be realised.&nbsp; There can be
little fear, however, that their condition could be worse, or
their prospects more disheartening than those which the
&lsquo;potato famine&rsquo; in this country, little mended by the
promise of Indian corn, had occasioned.&nbsp; <i>La faim chasse
le loup hors du bois</i>.&nbsp; To starve, or emigrate, are the
only alternatives of the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Waterford Chronicle</i> thus comments: &ldquo;There
will have gone, after the season is over, upwards of 3,000
people, from this country, by this port alone.&nbsp; Not to talk
of the rearing of these people&mdash;the trouble and expense of
bringing up a healthy man, woman, or child, and, especially,
leaving out the irreparable loss to society, in this country, of
their affections, hopes, and family ties&mdash;all, now, sundered
and destroyed&mdash;not to talk of the countless living deaths of
wholesale emigration from a feeling and warm-hearted mother
country&mdash;the amount of capital taken by these 3,000 is
immense.&nbsp; Assuming that each individual spends &pound;10 in
his passage, and before he settles, and that he has &pound;10
more to establish himself, here is direct taking away, in hard
cash, of &pound;60,000 gone out of the bleeding pores of Ireland,
to increase the misery which is left behind.&nbsp; We are in
possession of facts which show that many cunning landlords are
sending away their people yearly, but by degrees, and not in such
a manner as to subject themselves to a &lsquo;clearance
notice.&rsquo;&nbsp; If this system be continued, we shall be
tempted to give names.&nbsp; After these things, who will blame
the people for outbreaks <!-- page 294--><a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>occasioned
by famine?&nbsp; There is nothing plentiful in the land but
ruin!&nbsp; Employment is scarce&mdash;money is scarce&mdash;the
people are being thinned&mdash;farms are being
consolidated&mdash;bullock land is progressing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a
prey,<br />
Where cows accumulate, and men decay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For some long time there had been a conflict of opinion as to
the merits of different sized gauges for railways.&nbsp; Brunel,
the magnificent, advocated a width of seven feet, and practised
it on the Great Western; others wished for something far more
modest.&nbsp; Great was the wrangling over this &ldquo;battle of
the gauges,&rdquo; and a Royal Commission was appointed to
inquire into the matter.&nbsp; They gave in their Report on 30
May, and the question was settled by &ldquo;An Act for regulating
the Gauge of Railways&rdquo; (9 and 10 Vic., c. 57&mdash;passed
18 Aug., 1846) by which it was settled that, in future, all
Railway lines in England were to be 4 feet 8&frac12; in. wide,
and in Ireland, the width was to be 5 ft. 3 in.</p>
<p>By the way, Railway surveyors were paid well, and almost
everyone that had ever dragged a chain posed as a surveyor.&nbsp;
As a sample&mdash;on 23 Ap. is reported the case of White
<i>v.</i> Koe and Maun&mdash;where a witness said
&ldquo;Levellers are always well paid.&nbsp; I have received,
before this &pound;10 a mile, and I could level from seven to
eight miles a day.&nbsp; These are not extraordinary terms.&nbsp;
I had to find hands to help me.&nbsp; I had three men at 7s. a
day each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On 22 June poor Haydon, the painter, committed suicide.&nbsp;
He was extremely egotistical, and nothing could persuade him that
he was not the best painter of his time.&nbsp; His fixed idea was
that he was without a peer&mdash;but no one else thought
so.&nbsp; His diary is very sad reading.&nbsp; Here is an entry
(Ap. 13) relative to the exhibition of his picture, &ldquo;The
Banishment of Aristides&rdquo;: &ldquo;Receipts &pound;1 3s.
6d.&nbsp; An advertisement of a finer description could not have
been written to catch the public; but not a shilling more was
added to the receipts.&nbsp; They rush by thousands to see Tom

caravans, but do not read them; their eyes are on them, but their
sense is gone.&nbsp; It is an insanity&mdash;a <i>rabies

Englishmen could have been guilty.&rdquo;&nbsp; He even wrote to
the <i>Times</i> about it: &ldquo;<span class="smcap">General Tom

<p>The inauguration of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s Monument, at
Edinburgh, took place on 15 Aug., the anniversary of his
birth.&nbsp; It was erected in 1840&ndash;44, after designs by
Mr. George M. Kemp, at a cost of &pound;15,650.&nbsp; It is
cruciform, with a Gothic spire, chiefly modelled on the details
of Melrose Abbey; and includes, beneath its basement arches, a
Carrara marble sitting statue of Scott, with his dog
<i>Maida</i>, by his side, which is the work of Mr. Steel, and
cost &pound;2,000.</p>
<p>The potato crop utterly failed again in Ireland, and the
outlook there was indeed black.&nbsp; In the <i>Times</i> of 2
Sep., its correspondent, writing from Dublin, on 31 Aug., says:
&ldquo;As it is now an admitted fact, on all sides, that the
destruction of the early potato crop is complete, there can be no
earthly use <!-- page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 298</span>in loading your columns with
repetitions of the sad details, as furnished day after day in the
accounts published by the Irish newspapers.&nbsp; It will,
therefore, nearly suffice to say that, according to the reports
from all quarters, the crisis of deep and general distress cannot
be much longer averted, and that it will require all the energies
of both Government and Landlords to mitigate the inevitable
consequences of a calamity, of which both parties have been duly
forewarned.&nbsp; In the meantime, the following statement in a
Limerick paper of Saturday, is another curious illustration of
the Irish &lsquo;difficulty&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the Corn Market, this day, there appeared
about 4,000 bushels of oats, and about an equal quantity of
wheat.&nbsp; All this grain was purchased up, principally for
exportation, whilst the food of the people, as exhibited this day
in the Potato Market, was a mass of disease and rottenness.&nbsp;
This is an anomaly which no intricacies of political
economy&mdash;no legal quibbles, or crochets&mdash;no Government
arrangements can reconcile.&nbsp; In an agricultural country
which produces the finest corn for the food of man, we have to
record that the corn is sold and sent out of the country, whilst
the individuals that raised it by their toil and labour, are
threatened with all the horrors of starvation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From a multiplicity of concurrent statements respecting
the pestilence, I shall merely subjoin one, which appears in the
last <i>Tralee</i> paper: &lsquo;A man would hardly dig in a day,
as much sound potatoes as himself would consume.&nbsp; But that
is not the worst of it.&nbsp; Common cholera has set in among the
people of the town, owing to the use of potatoes, which contain a
large quantity of poisonous matter.&nbsp; A professional
gentleman in this town, of considerable experience and
unquestioned integrity, assures me, that he has attended, within
the last fortnight, in this town and neighbourhood, more than 12
cases of common cholera, and that he would think a person as safe
in consuming a certain quantity of arsenic, as in using the
potatoes now exposed for sale.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is how the Famine of 1846&ndash;7 began, and what
followed is a matter of history, which everyone ought to know,
and <!-- page 299--><a name="page299"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 299</span>ponder well over, but it can hardly
come under the name of Gossip.&nbsp; There were, naturally, a few
food riots in different parts of the country, but everyone tried
to do their best, even in a blundering way, to alleviate the
distress.&nbsp; The Archbishop of Canterbury composed a Special
Form of Prayer, to be used on Sunday, 11 Oct.</p>
<p>On 29 Sep. the gigantic equestrian statue of the Duke of
Wellington, which used to crown the arch opposite Apsley House,
and which was taken down 24 Jan., 1883, and then set up at
Aldershot, was moved from the artist&rsquo;s (Wyatt) studio, in
Harrow Road, to Hyde Park.&nbsp; It was 27 feet high, and weighed
about 40 tons, being made of brass guns taken by the Duke in
various victories.&nbsp; Being of so great a weight, the
appliances to remove it were on an equally massive scale, the
carriage and framework in which it was placed weighing about 20
tons.&nbsp; It took 100 soldiers to haul the statue out of the
studio; and, when mounted on its carriage, it took 29 huge dray
horses, lent by Mr. Goding, of the Lion Brewery, Waterloo, to
drag it to its destination.&nbsp; It was escorted by soldiers and
military bands, and did the distance in about an hour a
half.&nbsp; The next day was spent in preparing to hoist it; the
day after, it was lifted some 50 feet, and there remained all
night&mdash;and the next day was safely landed and put in
position.&nbsp; From that time, until it was taken down, it was
the butt of scoffs and jeers, and no one regretted its
departure.</p>
<p>Gun cotton was brought into public notice by some experiments
by its inventor, Professor Sch&ouml;nbein, of Basel, before the
chairman of the East India Company, and a number of
scientists.&nbsp; Professor Brande had previously lectured upon
it, at the Royal Institution, on 15 Jan., when he stated that,
about fifteen years before, Braconnot had ascertained that
sawdust, wood shavings, starch, linen and cotton fabrics, when
treated with concentrated nitric acid, produced a gelatinous
substance, which coagulated into a white mass, on the addition of
water; this substance, which he called &ldquo;xyloidine,&rdquo;
was highly inflammable.&nbsp; Sch&ouml;nbein, however, made his
explosive from purified cotton, steeped in a mixture of equal
parts of <!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>nitric and sulphuric acids, which
when carefully washed, and dried, kept its appearance of cotton
wool.&nbsp; In the <i>Times</i> of 4 Nov., is a notice of Gun
sawdust (a powder now much used), made by Mr. George Turner of
Leeds.</p>
<p>Whilst on the subject of Chemicals, I may as well mention,
what was much talked of at the time&mdash;the discovery of
sulphuric ether, when inhaled, being an an&aelig;sthetic.&nbsp;
Previous to this, Nitrous Oxide, or, as it was called,
&ldquo;Laughing Gas,&rdquo; somewhat inadequately performed the
same function.&nbsp; This latter was discovered by Dr. Priestley,
in 1776, and its use, as an an&aelig;sthetic, recommended by Sir
H. Davey in 1880, was put into practice by Mr. Wells, in America,
to lessen the pain in extracting teeth in 1844.</p>
<p>The first notice of the inhalation of sulphuric ether that I
know of, is in No. XLV. of the <i>British and Foreign Medical
Review</i>, which says: &ldquo;Just as our last proof was passing
through our hands, we received from our medical friends in
Boston, the account of a matter so interesting to surgeons, and,
indeed to everyone, that we take the opportunity of introducing
it here.&nbsp; We know nothing more of this new method of
eschewing pain than what is contained in the following extracts
from two private letters, kindly written to us by our excellent
friends Dr. Ware and Dr. Warren, of Boston&mdash;both men of the
highest eminence in their profession in America&mdash;and, we may
truly say, in Europe also.&nbsp; It is impossible, however, not
to regard the discovery as one of the very highest importance,
not in the practice of operative surgery only, but, also, as Dr.
Ware suggests, in practical medicine.&nbsp; We trust our friends
will forgive us for putting into print their private
communications.&nbsp; The importance of the subject, and the
necessity of authenticating the statements, are our
excuses.&nbsp; The authors of the discovery are Dr. C. T. Jackson
and Dr. Morton.</p>
<p>Dr. Warren writes, under date of 24 Nov., that &ldquo;In six
cases, I have had it applied with satisfactory success, and no
unpleasant sequel.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Dr. Ware (29 Nov.) says:
&ldquo;It was brought into use by a dentist, and is, now, chiefly
employed by that class of practitioners.&nbsp; He has taken out a
patent for <!-- page 301--><a name="page301"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 301</span>the discovery, and has despatched
persons to Europe to secure one there also; so you will soon hear
of it, and, probably, have an opportunity of witnessing its
effects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then follows a long list of operations performed in
America&mdash;wound up with this postscript: &ldquo;Dec.
22.&nbsp; Yesterday, we had, ourselves, this new mode of cheating
pain put in practice by a master of chirurgery, on our own side
of the Atlantic.&nbsp; In the theatre of University College
Hospital, Mr. Liston amputated the thigh of a man, previously
narcotized by the inhalation of ether vapour.&nbsp; Shortly after
being placed on the operating table, the patient began to inhale,
and became apparently insensible in the course of two or three
minutes.&nbsp; The operation was then commenced, and the limb was
removed in, what seemed to us, a marvellously short
time&mdash;certainly less than a minute; the patient remaining
during the incisions and the tying of the arteries, perfectly
still and motionless.&nbsp; While the vessels were being secured,
on being spoken to, he roused up partially (still showing no
signs of pain), and answered questions put to him, in a slow,
drowsy manner.&nbsp; He declared to us that at no part of the
operation had he felt pain, though he seemed to be partially
conscious; he had heard some words, and felt that something was
being done to his limb.&nbsp; He was not aware, till told, that
the limb was off; and, when he knew it, expressed great
gratification at having been saved from pain.&nbsp; The man
seemed quite awake when removed from the operating room, and
continued so.&nbsp; Everything has since proceeded as usual, and
very favourably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Liston afterwards performed one of the
minor&mdash;but most painful operations of surgery&mdash;the
partial removal of the nail, in <i>onychia</i>, on a man
similarly narcotised, and with precisely the same result.&nbsp;
The patient seemed to feel no pain; and, upon rousing up, after
the operation, declared that he had felt none.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Punch</i> found another and more domestic use for this
an&aelig;sthetic.</p>
<p><!-- page 302--><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>Not only was there advance in medicine, but, also, in social
science&mdash;people began to think that the condition of the
working classes might be ameliorated by giving them better
dwellings.&nbsp; As yet, little or nothing had been done, in this
way, in London, but a grand opportunity occurred at Liverpool, in
the building of Birkenhead, and an extensive range of model
dwellings were erected, four-storied, with ornate exterior, the
rents varying from 3s. to 5s. per set of rooms, according to
position; but this included a constant supply of water, and the
use of one gas burner in each set of rooms, and all rates and
taxes; with, moreover, two iron bedsteads, a grate with an oven,
and convenient fixtures; and they were found to answer
financially.</p>
<p>The Queen&rsquo;s consent was given on 26 Aug. to an
&ldquo;Act to Encourage the Establishment of Public Baths and
Wash-houses&rdquo; (9&ndash;10 Vic., c. 74).&nbsp; How it was
appreciated by the animals called &ldquo;Vestrymen&rdquo; may be
seen by the fact that at a Vestry meeting of the inhabitants of
St. Leonard&rsquo;s, Shoreditch, <!-- page 303--><a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>held 26
Oct., the subject was brought forward, when an amendment was
moved &ldquo;that it be taken into consideration that day six
months.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the amendment, 28; against 20!</p>
<p>The dangers of Smithfield Market were becoming too apparent,
as we see by a letter in the <i>Times</i> of 26 Nov.:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;Your paper of this morning again
gives an account of more accidents arising in consequence of
cattle being driven along our crowded streets, and we may expect
to hear of numerous, probably some fatal, injuries being
sustained during the short, and, often, very dark days, which are
common for some months in the winter.&nbsp; Everyone, whose
avocations call him into the city, has to complain of the delay
arising from the over-crowded state of the leading thoroughfares;
and, on Smithfield Market days, the obstruction is greatly
increased by the droves of cattle and sheep which, in a
bewildered, and frequently infuriated state, are being forced by
crowds of men, boys, and dogs, along the streets, to the great
annoyance, and, often, danger, of the passengers.&nbsp; I do not
here dwell on the revolting scenes of cruelty to the animals,
which everyone has to witness and deplore; but, on the ground of
danger to <!-- page 304--><a name="page304"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 304</span>human life, and, also, because of
the seriously increased obstruction to the general traffic, which
is caused by having the cattle market in the heart of the
metropolis, I would urge the removal of Smithfield Market to some
more appropriate place.&nbsp; When this has been
effected&mdash;when <i>abattoirs</i> have been constructed,
where, alone, all the larger animals are permitted to be
slaughtered, and when cattle are allowed to be driven through the
streets only at hours before the business of the day has
commenced&mdash;then, and not before, will London be, in
reference to its cattle market and slaughter houses, what is
required in the middle of the nineteenth century.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Punch</i> gives us the following lyric on the subject:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The
Bull Fight of Smithfield</span>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s trampling feet in Goswell Street, there&rsquo;s
row on Holborn Hill,<br />
There&rsquo;s crush and crowd, and swearing loud, from bass to
treble shrill;<br />
From grazier cad, and drover lad, and butcher shining greasy,<br
/>
And slaughter men, and knacker&rsquo;s men, and policemen free
and easy.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis Monday morn, and onward borne to Smithfield&rsquo;s
mart repair<br />
The pigs and sheep, and, lowing deep, the oxen fine and fair;<br
/>
They&rsquo;re trooping on from Islington, and down Whitechapel
road,<br />
To wild halloo of a shouting crew, and yelp, and bite, and
goad.</p>
<p>From combs of distant Devonshire, from sunny Sussex wold,<br
/>
From where their Durham pastures the stately short-horns hold;<br
/>
From Herefordshire marches, from fenny Cambridge flat,<br />
For London&rsquo;s maw they gather&mdash;those oxen fair and
fat.</p>
<p>The stunted stocks of Cambria&rsquo;s rocks uneasily are
lowing,<br />
With redder blaze of wild amaze their eyes around them
throwing;<br />
And the unkempt stot of Galloway, and the Kyloe of the Mearns,<br
/>
Whose hoof, that crush&rsquo;d the heather tuft, the mild <span
class="smcap">Macadam</span> spurns.</p>
<p>They may talk of <i>plaza mayors</i>, of <i>torero&rsquo;s</i>
nimble feat,<br />
Of <span class="smcap">Montez</span>, the famed <i>matador</i> of
<i>picadors</i> so fleet;<br />
But what is Spanish Bull fight to deeds which we can show,<br />
When through the street, at all they meet, the Smithfield oxen
go?</p>
<p>See there, see there, where, high in air, the nurse and
nurseling fly!<br />
Into a first-floor window, see, where that old gent, they shy!<br
/>
Now they&rsquo;re bolting into parlours, now they&rsquo;re
tumbling into cellars,<br />
To the great disgust and terror of the peaceable indwellers.</p>

Knight, I ween;<br />
By girth and span an alderman, nor less by port and mien.<br />
Look out, look out! that sudden shout! the Smithfield herd is
nigh!<br />
Now turn, Sir Knight, and boldly fight, or, more discreetly,
fly.</p>
<p>He hath eased round on his saddle, all fidgetty and fast;<br

There&rsquo;s another herd behind him, and the time for flight is
past.<br />
Full in his front glares a rabid runt, thro&rsquo; tears of pain

For the drover&rsquo;s almost twisted off the tail that hangs
behind him.</p>
<p>All lightly armed for such a shock was stout <span

But he couched his new umbrella, and &ldquo;Police&rdquo; aloud
cried he!<br />

And the Knight, in mazy circles, is flying thro&rsquo; the

<p>The runt tears on, the rout is gone, the street is calm once

And to Bartlemy&rsquo;s they bear him, extended on a door;<br />

That padded out thy civic ribs, and lined thy stately paunch.</p>
<p>No ribs are broke, but a shattering stroke thy system has

And, soon as he had breath to swear, the Knight right roundly
swore<br />
That, straight, he&rsquo;d put down Smithfield, and set up an

</blockquote>
<p>In this year there were sold at Smithfield 226,132 beasts,
1,593,270 sheep and lambs, 26,356 calves, and 33,531
pigs&mdash;to deal with which there were about 160
salesmen.&nbsp; Things went on very much in the same style as
described in <i>Punch</i> until 1851, when the contracted space
of the market, the slaughtering places adjoining, and many other
nuisances, gave grounds for general dissatisfaction, and after an
investigation, an Act (14&ndash;15 Vic., c. 61) was passed on 1
Aug. &ldquo;For providing a Metropolitan Market, and conveniences
therewith, in lieu of the Cattle Market at
Smithfield.&rdquo;&nbsp; A suitable site was found in Copenhagen
Fields, Islington; the last market at Smithfield was held on 11
June, and the first at the new one on 13 June, 1855.</p>
<p>The <i>Hampshire Guardian</i>, copied into the <i>Times</i> of
12 Dec., gives us the story of the first submarine Telegraph:
&ldquo;We are enabled to supply the following additional
particulars respecting the submarine Telegraph laid down across
our harbour.&nbsp; It is now about three years since the
telegraph <!-- page 306--><a name="page306"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 306</span>from the Nine Elms terminus to the
terminus at Gosport was first established.&nbsp; Subsequently,
from the inconvenience experienced at the Admiralty Office here,
because of the distance to the telegraph station, the wires were
continued from that place to the Royal Clarence Yard.&nbsp; With
this addition, although the inconvenience was lessened, it was
far from being removed, the harbour intervening, leaving a
distance of upwards of a mile, to the Admiral&rsquo;s house,
unconnected; and, notwithstanding the wish of the authorities,
both here and in London, that the telegraph should be carried to
the Dockyard, no attempt has, hitherto, been made to do so,
because it has been considered almost impossible to convey it
under water.&nbsp; An offer, indeed, was made to the Admiralty,
to lay down a telegraph enclosed in metallic pipes, which were to
be fixed under the water by the aid of diving bells.&nbsp; This
scheme, having been found to be impracticable, has been very
prudently abandoned.&nbsp; Whatever difficulties may have
hitherto interfered to prevent the establishment of submarine
telegraphs, appear, now, to have been entirely overcome, for the
time occupied from the commencement of carrying the telegraph
from shore to shore, and transmitting signals, did not occupy a
quarter of an hour.&nbsp; The telegraph, which has the appearance
of an ordinary rope, was coiled into one of the dockyard boats,
one end of it being made fast on shore, and, as the boat was
pulled across, the telegraphic rope was gradually paid out over
the stern, its superior gravity causing it to sink to the bottom
immediately. . . . Independently of the simplicity of this
submarine telegraph, it has an advantage which even the
telegraphs on land do not possess&mdash;in the event of an
accident, it can be replaced in ten minutes.&nbsp; The success of
the trial here has, we understand, determined the inventors to
lay down their contemplated line across the Channel, from England
to France, under the sanction of the respective
Governments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the germ of the multitudinous cables which now span
every ocean.</p>

<p>At this time, at all events, we did not plaster our soldiers
with medals for every trifling deed of duty, and it was not until
January of this year, that a Commission was appointed to decide
upon the medals which were to be presented to the officers and
men who served in the Peninsula, under Wellington and other
commanders.&nbsp; And it was not till the 1st of June, that an
Order was issued from the Horse Guards, that claims might be sent
in by those who were present in battles from 1793 to
1814&mdash;or, rather, the list began with Maida, 1806, and ended
with Toulouse, 1814.&nbsp; The medals for naval service began
with the &ldquo;Glorious First of June,&rdquo; 1794, and ended
with the fight between the Endymion and President on 25 Jan.,
1815.&nbsp; The Medal for Waterloo was granted some long time
afterwards.</p>
<p>In January, the British Museum received the splendid bequest
of the Library of Thomas Grenville, Esqre., who died 17 Dec.,
1846.&nbsp; This magnificent library of over 20,000 volumes,
valued at the very low estimate of &pound;50,000, contains two
copies of the Mazarin bible, one on vellum, a first folio of
Shakespere, Caxton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Reynard the Fox,&rdquo; and
countless other literary treasures and rarities.&nbsp; He had
intended to leave this library to the Duke of
Buckingham&mdash;but, reflecting that as most of the books had
been paid for with the proceeds of a sinecure office (Chief
Justice in eyre, south of the Trent) <!-- page 308--><a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>of
&pound;2,000 a year, which he had held from 1800 to 1817, when it
was abolished, he felt it only just that they should be given to
the nation, who had virtually paid for them.&nbsp; With them
came, as curator, his valet, Mr. Holden, who remained with his
master&rsquo;s beloved books until three or four years since.</p>
<p>On 9 March a Royal Proclamation was issued for a day of
Fasting and humiliation on account of the famine and distress in
Ireland, and it was duly kept on the day set apart for it, 24
March.</p>
<p>There is a curious paragraph in the <i>Times</i> of 23 March:
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Binding of Satan</span>.&mdash;During
the past two or three weeks, a number of persons have been going
round the streets, on the Surrey side of the water, wearing
belts, like those worn by the fire brigade, on which passages
from the Scriptures are painted, carrying with them an inkhorn
and long sheets of paper, soliciting signatures to what they
pretend to be a petition to Heaven, for the binding of Satan, the
Prince of darkness.&nbsp; So eager are those persons to get the
paper signed, that men, women, and children are stopped
indiscriminately, and requested to sign.&nbsp; Those who are too
young to sign, or unable to write their names, have the same done
for them by the men, who do not attempt to disguise the fact of
belonging to the followers of Joanna Southcote.&nbsp; Upon
several occasions, a great deal of confusion has been created by
the parties, for they generally manage to go about with knots of
forty or fifty persons; and, occasionally, discussions ensue,
which are calculated to bring the Scriptures into perfect
ridicule.&nbsp; One person, more intelligent than the persons who
are hawking the petitions about, inquired who it is that will
present the petition? when the man replied, with the greatest
coolness, that as soon as a sufficient number of names are
attached to the petition, it will be presented to the Throne of
Mercy by Joanna Southcote herself.&nbsp; Surely it is high time
that such exhibitions were put down by the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early in April a circular from the Home Secretary was
forwarded to the magistrates at the various gaols, telling them
that, in consequence of the suspension of transportation of <!--
page 309--><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

requisite for them to make immediate provision for the
confinement and employment, in this country, of a great number of
such offenders.</p>
<p>On the 14th of April the Queen paid a visit of inspection to
the New House of Lords, and, on the next day, the Peers took
possession of it, and transacted business there for the first
time.</p>
<p>Talk of Gossip, was there ever such food for it as the arrival
of Jenny Lind&mdash;it was a furore, a madness.&nbsp; She arrived
in London late on the afternoon of Ap. 17, and was present in the
evening at the performance at Her Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre.&nbsp;
On May 4 she made her first appearance on the Stage in
England&mdash;in this Theatre&mdash;where she played in
&ldquo;Robert le Diable,&rdquo; and, from that moment, until the
end of the season, nothing else was thought of&mdash;nothing else
talked of&mdash;but Jenny Lind, and it was no short-lived fit of
enthusiasm, for she was <i>the</i> favourite of the public until
her retirement; her beautiful voice and simplicity of manner
charming everyone, from Royalty downwards.&nbsp; Unfortunately
her d&ecirc;but was somewhat marred by a pecuniary squabble
between her and Bunn, the operatic poet, a rival
<i>impresario</i>, Lumley, having secured her services.&nbsp;
Here is Punch&rsquo;s version of the squabble:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align:

<p><span class="smcap">Bunn</span> in a flaming frenzy flew,<br

With which he was accustomed to<br />

<p>He wrote the maiden to remind<br />
Her of a compact she had signed,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And threatened law

<p>Two thousand pounds she offered, so<br />
That he would only let her go;<br />
<span class="smcap">Bunn</span>, who would have his bond, said

<p>Died on 15th May, at Genoa, on his route to Rome, aged 72,
Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, the erst &ldquo;uncrowned King of
Ireland,&rdquo; who, during his lifetime, had been a thorn (and a
very troublesome one) in the side of every English
government.&nbsp; His heart was forwarded to Rome, but his body
was embalmed, and, in due time, was sent to Ireland for
interment.</p>
<p>The <i>Liverpool Albion</i>, quoted in the <i>Times</i> of 14
May, is responsible for the following story: &ldquo;Some time
ago, the Duke of Buccleugh, in one of his walks, purchased a cow
from a person in the neighbourhood of Dalkeith, and left orders
to send it to his palace on the following morning.&nbsp;
According to agreement, the cow was sent, and the Duke, who
happened to be <i>en d&eacute;shabille</i>, and walking in the
avenue, espied a little fellow ineffectually attempting to drive
the animal to its destination.&nbsp; The boy, not knowing the
Duke, bawled out to him: &lsquo;Hi! mun, come here an&rsquo;
gi&rsquo;us a han&rsquo; wi&rsquo; this beast.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
Duke saw the mistake, and determined to have a joke with the
little fellow.&nbsp; Pretending, therefore, not to understand
him, the Duke walked on slowly, the boy still craving his
assistance.&nbsp; At last, he cried in a tone of apparent
distress: &lsquo;Come here, mun, an&rsquo; help us, an&rsquo; as
sure as onything, I&rsquo;ll give ye half I get.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This last solicitation had the desired effect.&nbsp; The Duke
went and lent a helping hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;And now,&rsquo; said
the Duke, as they trudged along, &lsquo;how much do you think you
will get for this job?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, dinna ken,&rsquo;
said the boy, &lsquo;but I am sure o&rsquo; something, for the
folk up at <!-- page 312--><a name="page312"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 312</span>the house are good to a&rsquo;
bodies.&rsquo;&nbsp; As they approached the house, the Duke
darted from the boy, and entered by a different way.&nbsp; He
called a servant, and put a sovereign into his hand, saying,
&lsquo;Give that to the boy that has brought the
cow.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Duke returned to the avenue, and was soon
rejoined by the boy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, how much did you
get?&rsquo; said the Duke.&nbsp; &lsquo;A shilling,&rsquo; said
the boy, &lsquo;an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s the half o&rsquo;t to
ye.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;But, surely, you got more than a
shilling,&rsquo; said the Duke.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the
boy, with the utmost earnestness, &lsquo;as sure&rsquo;s death,
that&rsquo;s a&rsquo; I got&mdash;an&rsquo; d&rsquo;ye not think
it&rsquo;s a plenty?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not,&rsquo; said
the Duke; &lsquo;there must be some mistake; and, as I am
acquainted with the Duke, if you return, I think I&rsquo;ll get
you more.&rsquo;&nbsp; The boy consented; back they went.&nbsp;
The Duke rang the bell, and ordered all the servants to be
assembled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the Duke to the boy,
&lsquo;point out the person who gave you the
shilling.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It was that chap, there, with the
apron,&rsquo; pointing to the butler.&nbsp; The delinquent
confessed, fell on his knees, and attempted an apology; but the
Duke interrupted him, indignantly ordered him to give the boy the
sovereign, and quit his service instantly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have
lost,&rsquo; said the Duke, &lsquo;your money, your situation,
and your character, by your covetousness; learn, henceforth, that
honesty is the best policy.&rsquo;&nbsp; The boy, by this time,
recognised his assistant, in the person of the Duke, and the Duke
was so delighted with the sterling worth and honesty of the boy,
that he ordered him to be sent to school, kept there, and
provided for at his own expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eton &ldquo;Montem&rdquo; was abolished this year.&nbsp; It
was a triennial custom, and had for its purpose the presentation
of a sum of money to the Captain of the school on his departure
to the University.&nbsp; Every third year, on Whitsun Tuesday,
some of the Eton boys, clad in fancy costume (as is here given
from the Montem of 1844), went to Salt Hill, and the
neighbourhood generally, and levied contributions, or
&ldquo;Salt,&rdquo; from all passers-by.&nbsp; The custom led to
grave abuses, and the Provost and Head Master determined that it
should end, but, that the boy who benefited by it should not be a
loser, the latter, Dr. Hawtrey, gave him &pound;200 out of his
own pocket.&nbsp; <!-- page 313--><a name="page313"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 313</span>The following is an account of the
death and burial of Eton &ldquo;Montem&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tuesday, 25 May.&mdash;This being the day
on which the triennial festival of &lsquo;Montem&rsquo; would
have been celebrated at Eton and Salt Hill, had it not been
abolished by the Provost and the authorities of Eton,
considerable excitement prevailed in the vicinity of the College
from an early hour this morning, in consequence (from rumours
which had been in circulation for some time past) of its being
apprehended that some &lsquo;demonstration&rsquo; would be made
by the boys, assisted by several old Etonians from Oxford and
Cambridge (who are strongly opposed to the abolition of the
ceremony), which might lead to a breach of the peace.&nbsp; With
the exception of about a thousand small squares of glass being
demolished in the vicinity of the lower school, and similar
breakages, but to a much smaller extent, at the houses of parties
who were supposed to be in favour of the determination which had
been come to by the Provost, we have heard of no demonstration of
a riotous character on the part of the boys.&nbsp; This being a
&lsquo;whole holiday,&rsquo; several of the head boys had
permission to proceed in boats, up the Thames, for the <!-- page
314--><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>day, as far as Cliefden.&nbsp; Between 100 and 200
have, also, left for the Whitsun holidays; thus thinning the
number remaining at College to a considerable extent.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As soon as &lsquo;absence&rsquo; had been
called by the head master, the Rev. Dr. Hawtrey, shortly after 12
o&rsquo;clock, the boys, numbering between 200 and 300, formed in
procession in the playing fields, and marched across the fields,
preceded by a black flag, to the celebrated mount at Salt
Hill.&nbsp; They were joined by a great many of the old Etonians
from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, who arrived at
Eton this morning.&nbsp; Each wore, on his left arm, a band and
rosette of black crape, and many had white hatbands and
scarves.&nbsp; As they were seen wending their way towards Salt
Hill, they had all the appearance of mourners (merry though they
might be) in a funeral procession.&nbsp; Upon their arrival at
the Mount, the black flag was waved in solemn silence, and,
afterwards, placed on the summit, drooping on the ground, typical
of the lost glories of Montem.&nbsp; The large party then
proceeded to Botham&rsquo;s, at the Windmill Hotel, whence, after
partaking of a luncheon, they again returned to the Mount, and,
with the flag, retraced their steps back to College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A match at cricket was played during the day, between
the Oxonians and the present Etonians, in the shooting fields
attached to the College.&nbsp; A splendid cold collation was
provided, in the evening, for the players, by Mr. Clarke, of the
Christopher Inn.&nbsp; The waiters who attended upon the guests
were compelled to wear black crape around their arms, &lsquo;in
keeping,&rsquo; as it was observed, &lsquo;with the solemnity of
the occasion.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such were the fears entertained by
some of the College authorities that a disturbance might take
place in the course of the day, that a strong body of the
Metropolitan A division of police was stationed at Slough, in
plain clothes (as we are informed), to be in readiness to assist
the local authorities, in the event of their services being
required, it being expected that a mob, composed of the idle and
lazy of the two towns, might, in the course of the evening, show
some disposition to create a disturbance.&nbsp; The abolition of
Montem is not only considered to be a most unpopular proceeding
<!-- page 315--><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>on the part of the old and present Etonians; but, also,
by the tradesmen of Eton and Windsor, amongst the former of whom
a large sum of money was triennially circulated, both before and
during the festival.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Punch</i> has a lament on it, of which I reproduce three
verses:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Say, Hill of Salt, for thou hast seen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full many a noble race<br />
Do what might be considered mean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In any other case&mdash;<br />
With cap in hand, and courtly leg,<br />
Waylay the traveller, and beg;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Say, was it not a pleasing sight<br />
Those young Etonians to behold,<br />
For eleemosynary gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Arrest the passing wight.</p>
<p>Whilst some, of more excursive bent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their vagrant arts to ply,<br />
To all the various places went,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That in the neighbourhood lie;<br />
To Datchet, Slough, or Horton they,<br />
Or e&rsquo;en to Colnbrook, took their way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or ancient Windsor&rsquo;s regal town;<br />
Stopp&rsquo;d every body they could meet,<br />
Knocked at each house, in every street,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In hopes of half a crown.</p>
<p>Gay clothes were theirs, by fancy made;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some were as Romans drest,<br />
Some in the Grecian garb array&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some bore the knightly crest;<br />
Theirs was attire of every hue,<br />
Of every fashion, old, or new,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Various as Nathan&rsquo;s ample store.<br />
Angelic beings!&nbsp; Ladies! say<br />
Will ye let these things pass away?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must Montem be no more?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this, to the Accession of the Queen, there is no more
Gossip to chronicle.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
